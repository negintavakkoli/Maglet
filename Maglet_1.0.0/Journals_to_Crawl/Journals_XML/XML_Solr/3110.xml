The new wave of hiring has had both positive and negative effects. Negative effects (such as over-recruitment and crowding in companies, rising costs of human resources, etc.) have caused a crisis in some energy companies. The purpose of this study was to present a model for crisis management in oil companies' human resources system. The research method was descriptive survey and the statistical sample consisted of ۲۰۰ managers and experts of the National Iranian Oil Company. Statistical software was also used to analyze the results. The results showed that except for one index (identifying the probable events) all of the mentioned indicators of the model can be prescribed for human resource crisis management strategies in oil companies. The highest mean score is related to the index «Developing Human Resources Management Policies and Measures to Promote Motivation, Job Satisfaction and Commitment of Employees» and the next indicator is the priorities of implementing training courses for empowerment.</field></doc></add>
