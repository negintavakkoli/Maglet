One of the risks distinguishes urban projects from other projects is to purchase of property obstacles. The matter is of more significance in large projects. Issues with regard to possessing property obstacles, lack of accurate layout drawings for underground facilities and following probable changes in designs make it vital to have specific studies on risk management of such projects. So this paper investigates the implementation of risk management plan in large urban projects through a case study, namely Imam Ali highway. To do this, first some generic information is discussed in each section and then it is tried to show how incorporate it in the project studied. According to qualitative analysis done, the issues of obstacles, weak feasibility studies, and inadequacies of resources (scaffolding &amp; forming material) were the main risk factors of the project. In another effort, using Monte Carlo Simulation, the quantitative analysis was done on some outputs of qualitative analysis, and numerical probabilities to achieve scheduled finishing date of the project were obtained.
