This research tries to identify the effective criteria on location selection of activities by explaining the spatial distribution pattern of knowledge-based activities in Tehran. The research method is mixed and the population of the study includes ۵۶۰ knowledge-based companies in Tehran. Purposefully, ۵۰ managers of Tehran’s knowledge-based companies were interviewed to identify and prioritize the criteria for choosing the locations of companies, using Delphi techniques. Linear regression analysis was used in GIS software to analyze the data quantitatively and to find out the relationship between the location of activities and the criteria for locating. The findings of this study showed that access criteria to main arteries, access to fast transportation lines and access to the subway have the most explanatory power. Contrary to traditional theories of location, there is no significant relationship between the cost of ownership or lease and the location of knowledge-based activities in Tehran. Statistical analysis complementary to regression analysis identified university decisions to locate knowledge-based growth centers, as an effective unknown factor on current spatial distribution pattern. The results of this research provide a suitable tool for urban planners to revive the spatial arrangement of knowledge-based activities in Tehran with the aim of improving performance.</field></doc></add>
