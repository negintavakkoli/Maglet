			<abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ethical leadership on employee performance with the role of psychological ownership mediator. The present study is applied and descriptive-correlational, and the data were collected in the field survey. The statistical population of the study was the knowledge personnel of a military university. According to the Morgan and Karjets table, the sample size was estimated to be 210, selected through random-cluster sampling. To assess ethical leadership, psychological property, job performance, the questionnaires by Brown and et al. (2005), Van Dyne and Pierce (2004), and Patterson’s (2006) were used respectively. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (LISREL 8.54), and the findings showed that ethical leadership directly and indirectly influences employee performance through psychological ownership. Ethical leaders can increase individual awareness by changing the attitude and strengthening the sense of ownership toward the organization, and by providing emotional and cognitive attachment between the individual and the aim, they can influence an individual’s behavior to prepare the necessary basis for facilitating organizational process and increasing job performance.</abstract>

			<abstract>In project-based organizations, the temporary nature of the projects leads to memory weakness, forgetfulness of valuable experiences, and lessons learned from the project. Given the structure and objectives of the project-based military organizations, the milestone can be seen in the vital role of knowledge gained from projects for the survival of the organization. The purpose of this study is to identify the key barriers to knowledge management and lessons learned in the project-based military organizations. This research answers the question that “what the key barriers to knowledge management and lessons learned in project-based military organizations are and what the importance and priority of these obstacles is.” The sample population of this research contains 53 knowledge managers of the project-based military organizations with a knowledge management department based in Tehran, active in the field of manufacturing. The identification of these organizations is based on three indicators: being project-based, having independent knowledge management department, and having developmental activities. The study instrument was a questionnaire and a structured interview. The questionnaire was validated through military management experts and the reliability was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha (0.834). For inferential analysis, one-sample t-test and the Friedman test were used. The t test showed that 5 factors are statistically significant, and among these factors, content ones were more influential than the organizational factors. Finally, the barriers to knowledge management and lessons learned were identified in the project-based military organizations and classified in five sections. In addition, 13 steps in three layers were presented to reduce and improve the barriers of knowledge management and lessons learned in the project-based military organizations.</abstract>

			<abstract>Scientific development is the prerequisite for economic development in developing countries and is fulfilled through the catch-up process. It is a process in which a late-developed country, in attempt to reduce its income gap or increasing technological capabilities, attempts to lessen the technological gap with developed countries in different aspects, such as defense section and military organizations. In this path, the goal of this study is to conceptualize the technological catch-up processing in the defense maritime defense sector. Regarding the objective, this research is exploratory and qualitative. The data were obtained through interview with academic experts and the content analysis was performed using MXQDA software. The findings show that, considering the technological catch-up concept, nine main factors are ‘learning’, ‘knowledge base’, ‘systems and innovation network’, ‘technological regime’, ‘institutional regime’, ‘market regime’, ‘explanation and implementation of local development model’, ‘governmental supportive mechanisms’, and ‘human resource’.</abstract>

			<abstract>Many organizations and companies are looking for solutions to create regular and formal processes for project management that leads to higher discipline in conducting current projects in terms of time, budget, and quality level. Task description and various goals can be expected based on the needs and characteristics of an organizations, from setup to the project management office deployment. The most important expectation from the project management office is to create regular and integrated processes for project management in the form of a unified project management structure. Accordingly, the present study, using the previous research, aims to identify and explain the dimensions that guide organizations in using project management offices. The identified dimensions are presented as the requirements for the implementation of the project management office project model. In this research, the importance and necessity of the project management office was firstly stated and after expressing theoretical and conceptual models of the project management office, the project management office structure was described. The conceptual model of the research was presented and the elements of the conceptual model was identified. The Likert-scale questionnaire was composed using library and online studies, and was confirmed by the organization experts. To analyze the data, a military research organizations was selected as the case study.
