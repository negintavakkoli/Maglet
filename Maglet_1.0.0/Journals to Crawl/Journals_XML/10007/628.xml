	<abstract_fa>The term “physical development and land use” was primarily raised in the Western countries so that governments could monitor the way the land is used and to maintain property rights. However, with rapid growth of urbanization and development of urban and regional planning the dimensions and the contents of the concept have expanded day by day. The central and practical core of urban planning is the land use planning not only is categorized as a type of functional planning but also serves as a guide to direct urban development programs.  Urban land use planning refers to an organizing plan to arrange urban activities in order to achieve specific objectives and it plays a determinant role in physical development. The process of preparing the urban development plans is essentially reviewed and explained in a form of macro-planning process. Accordingly, given the centrality of the issue in line with the analysis of physical development in the Region 3 in Tehran, by recognizing the current opportunity and analyzing the characteristics and structure of the region under study, the present study tried to explain the issue and ultimately to explain the production in this area. The main goal of the present study is to recognize spatial structure of the Region 3 of Tehran in order to extract the potential problems and finally to devise the intended plan. </abstract_fa>
