It has paved the way for social injustice and having urban services land uses in the regions and neighborhoods of a city. This research has been developed in order to measure access level of residents in urban areas of Zahedan for required facilities and services. Initially, per capita of status quo of each individual from service uses of city’s status quo was extracted by using data and information of Zahedan comprehensive urban plan and then the extent and distribution of land uses in five districts of Zahedan were  examined by utilizing Williamson and entropy models. Finally, each district was evaluated and ranked in terms of having facilities and services. The results of Williamson and entropy models show unbalanced distribution and lack of services in district 4 due to large and increasing population. Balanced distribution of services is seen in district 5 and studying results of having urban services and facilities due to TOPSIS model shows that there is a big difference among urban areas in terms of accessibility and urban services so that the highest amount of TOPSIS for district 5 is 0.894 and the lowest amounts are 0.058 and 0.178 for districts 2 and 4 respectively.</field></doc></add>
