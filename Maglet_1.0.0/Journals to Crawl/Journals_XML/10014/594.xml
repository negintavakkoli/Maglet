Results show that social capital affects on inter and intra departments knowledge sharing; high educated employees have more social capital, however people with higher managerial experiences, show less social capital than less experienced employees. It seems that managers don&#8217;t prefer to share their knowledge and experiences with their subordinates especially the more competent or new employed ones.

Based on the related literature and accessible documents on this subject in POGC, the primary dimensions and components of strategic talent management were determined.&#160;Then, in order to fit the dimensions and components with the characteristics and expectations of company, the opinions of experts participating in interviews were analyzed by using content analysis method. In this way, the initial model of strategic talent management in POGC was designed. After evaluating and modifying the initial model by a second-order factor analysis, the final model was designed.&#160;In comparison with current domestic and international models, some distinct features of this model are its systematic basis, comprehensiveness and also its strategic approach that leads to consider the external environment and its adaptation with the internal environment and more importantly, the use of this strategic model of talent management helps POGC officials to have a&#160;unified framework for the identisication, development, maintenance and keeping ahead of valuable human capital rather than repeating what is done in human resource management department, and thereby meet the emerging challenges and needs of the company. &#160;},
