						<title>An Analysis of the Behaviour of Citizens in People-oriented Suburban Spaces By using Pearson Correlation Coefficient; (Case study: the Centre of Sultan Mir Ahmad Neighbourhood, Kashan)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1729&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies conducted in the field of behaviour show that the necessity of noticing and determining urban space behaviour in field studies as well as surveys on dynamic small spaces is undeniable. Small urban spaces, including people-oriented spaces, involve social interactions. This study aims to consider the effect of small urban spaces on the volume of people&amp;rsquo;s social interactions and participations. The sample group consists of 184 residents and passers-by in the centre of the Sultan Mir Ahmad neighbourhood on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Information on variables was obtained through the behavioural questionnaire together with the related theoretical analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between behavioural indicators and people&amp;rsquo;s turnout, while the regression model was used to determine the weight of each index. According to the studies, components such as awareness, people, purpose, etc. can be impactful from different perspectives in the incidence of behaviour in urban spaces. It can also identify features of behaviour in urban spaces, which can overall be considered in studies on urban space and behaviourism. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the neighbourhood centres considered in the study; five indicators show the correlation to preferential behaviour ranging from 39% (highest) to 19% (lowest).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Evaluation of Financing Effects Through  Direct Taxes on Economic Growth in Iran</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1730&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;In most countries, a major source of government revenue is funded through taxes. Tax share of total public revenues is different among countries and the rate depends on the level of development and economic structure. For this reason, the necessity to understanding of causes, aggravating factors, tax evasion, providing practical solutions and scientific recommendations will be inevitable. According to the current study by using a smooth transition regression (STR) and annual data from 1971-2015, we investigate the effects of direct financing through amendments of direct tax law on economic growth in Iran's conventional model of economic growth. The results of this study, along with the theoretical foundations and the prevailing belief of most economists, showed that the effect of different methods of financing through direct taxes on economic growth in Iran conditional on the state of the economy, in particular in accordance with the results of investment. It means that in the first regime, when the investment share of GDP is became less than 34/05 percent, financed by oil revenues has negative effects and finan&lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cing through tax revenues had a positive effect on economic growth. But in the second regime, when the investment share of GDP is more than 28/01 percent, the financing of both oil and tax revenues had a positive effect on economic growth. Although in the second regime and by increasing the investment to keep pace with positive impact on the severity funded through tax revenues increased.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Nonlinear inelastic dynamic analysis of space steel frames with semi-rigid connections in urban buildings</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1734&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Applied studies addressing semi-rigid connections have been limited. Scant information exists in regulations except little brief information. Therefore, this research analyzes the behavior of three-dimensional steel frames and semi-rigid connections based on beam-column method and non-linear dynamic analysis. Stability functions and geometric stiffness matrix were used to study the non-linear geometric behavior of members. Then the dynamic behavior of rotational springs was simulated by stiffening, and the non-linear load-displacement responses and the final results were compared to prior studies that have taken place. It was finally concluded that the method used to analyze the semi-rigid connections was efficient, and if one element per member is used and a precise monitoring is delivered, end sections and nonlinear steel frames behavior with semi-rigid connections can be predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

						<description>&lt;p&gt;Biology has been a brilliant teacher and a precious textbook to man-made construction for thousands of years, because it allows one to learn and be inspired by nature&amp;rsquo;s remarkable and efficient structural systems. Concepts unfortunately have this in common that in general use often specifies incorrectly some phenomena. There was a turning point in each period of time which human has discovered a new sight about the world and nature order in a way, and then has presented this relation by numeral, artful and industrial language. The relation between nature and human considers different periods. At first it was bio-utilization which degrades the value of nature as a source of energy and material. After revolution in science development and attention to the damages which they made to environment, they tried to change their look to this issue and expand the mean of relation between human and nature. Birth of such word like bio architecture emphasize on the new point of view at nature. The role of nature and importance of natural resources in human&amp;rsquo;s social-economic (and even his psychological) life is undeniable, and also it is essential to note that God is the Creator and man the explorer. This paper aims to call a close multidisciplinary collaboration that promotes engineers to build more sustainable and smart structural systems for bridges in the 21st century. In this article survey the introduction of bionic architecture and related categories.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Analysis of Impacts on spatial planning objectives in the New Cities using network techniques (ANP) (Case Study: New Cities in Gulbahar and Binalood)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1741&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Following the creation of economic, social and environmental issues in metropolises, strategies aimed to build new cities to decentralize, attract the overflow of crowed population and reduce its activity, in order to enhance the quality of life and to organize the population and activity in urban areas. In the present study, the role of spatial planning for new towns in the metropolitan suburbs of Mashhad or in other words, the role of these new towns on the space balance, creating the employment and self-sufficiency and to absorb some part of Mashhad&amp;rsquo;s population has been studied. In this regard, in addition to the library studies and comparisons of existing status with the predicted targets for studying new cities, two series of questions regarding the condition of every new town, as well as analysis network process (ANP) were used to assess their success and to rank them. Results showed that the infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s indicator plays the greatest role in the success or failure of these cities in achieving their goals, so if the government does not provide the platform and infrastructure, new towns policy does not help resolve the crisis of metropolitans. After infrastructure, employment, attraction of people and accessibility have almost equally important and are in secondary importance. Eventually, our results revealed that Gulbahar has been more successful than Binalud, According to the results of the present study, the coordinated and proper management at national and regional levels, especially in the Mashhad conurbation, creation of employment opportunities, improving the identify and the quality of new towns and provide appropriate services is necessary and&amp;nbsp; essential to citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

						<description>&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle which encompasses social,&amp;nbsp;cultural, and economic&amp;nbsp;factors deeply impacts upon the people's behavioral patterns and mental attitudes.&amp;nbsp;One of the manifestations of&amp;nbsp;lifestyle is&amp;nbsp;the quality of selecting living&amp;nbsp;places,&amp;nbsp;which in turn influences&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;architecture&amp;nbsp;of the houses. &amp;nbsp; The purpose of the present study is to examine the extent to which modern lifestyle affected Hamadanian people`s lifestyle as well as the architecture of their houses during the first Pahlavi regime. The study adopted a historical-interpretive analytical method which describes the modern lifestyle of Hamedanian people by taking the transition from tradition to modernity into account and investigates the conceptual components of the architectural modernism of the houses using&amp;nbsp;architectural space analysis.&amp;nbsp;The data for the study were collected through library resources and field study. The sampling method for the field study was purposive.&amp;nbsp;To this end, all the houses built during the first Pahlavi regime which had documents and were possible to visit for a filed study were examined. The results provided evidence for the modernization of people`s lifestyle which led to &amp;nbsp;new concepts of&amp;nbsp;modern&amp;nbsp;lifestyle,&amp;nbsp;such as consumerism, the development of social interaction, the initial formation of civility, social distinction and status, and&amp;nbsp;social&amp;nbsp;importance of&amp;nbsp;women.&amp;nbsp;Moreover, the findings show that changes in lifestyle resulted in&amp;nbsp;the formation of&amp;nbsp;three different architectural patterns. Garden houses,&amp;nbsp;street houses, and evolved traditional houses were considered as reflections of architectural changes. These evolutions show the changes in people`s lifestyle&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;as a result of transition from tradition to modernity&amp;nbsp; and the evolution of architectural space due to the changes in the quality of modernism style of life.&lt;/p&gt;

						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1747&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Score for exposure factor is the sum of scores for the five criteria of precipitation, temperature, wind, weather phenomena, and horizontal visibility. Hourly data on precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, weather condition codes, and horizontal visibility obtained at 23 synoptic stations in the Province, and from those located in an area within a radius of 100 kilometers from the borders of it, since the time they were established up to the end of 2012, was first received from Iran Meteorological Organization. Those stations were then selected that had data related to eight daily measurements in the interval 1990-2010. Based on this, data processing was carried out for nine stations (five in Kermanshah Province and four in neighboring Provinces) within MATLAB environment. The scores for exposure factors for climate change in two five-year intervals were calculated to assess climate vulnerability of Kermanshah Province. In the next stage, the study period was divided into three intervals: the base interval (from 23, 9, 1990 to 21, 9, 2000), the first interval (from 22, 9, 2000 to 22, 9, 2005), and the second interval (from 23, 9, 2005 to 22, 9, 2010). Following that, exposure criteria and markers were determined. It was then necessary to define and measure a broad range of markers because of the temporal-spatial non-uniformity in the climate of Kermanshah Province that results from land location and variety in this Province. In the present research, climatic data was processed in the framework of five criteria that included 29 markers. In general, it was found that Kermanshah Province is faced with increased hazards resulting from current changes in climate.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>The Effect of Audit Quality on Costs Stickiness in Manufacturing Companies Listed in Tehran Stock Exchange</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1748&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental presumptions of management audit shows that change in costs is in fir correlation with increase and decrease in activity level. However, this assumption is discussed with considering the cost stickiness by Anderson et al. it means that the amount of increase in costs with the increase in activity level is more than reduction in costs per same amount of reduction in activity level. On the other hand, audit could increase the reliability of information available for the users and with the increase in audit quality; quality of information is also enhanced. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of audit quality on cost stickiness in manufacturing companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange. Statistical population of this study consists of companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2007 to 2014. To measure the correlation of research variables, Pearson correlation test is used and finally, to test research hypotheses, generalized ordinary least-squares regression is used.

						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1753&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, with the development of urbanization and increased abnormal behaviors, particularly urban crimes, prevention of social harms is of great importance. Social Sciences and Urban Development can prevent crime in urban areas by understanding cultural and social traits alongside other actions, in a way that the wrongdoer finds less opportunity for acting a criminal behavior in urban areas&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; The theory of social capital is intrinsically simple and affecting many other components. The core idea of social capital can be found and summed up in the word &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot;. Members of the community can cooperate and work together through making contacts with each other sustaining this relation. And thus they learn things that cannot be easily achieved alone or is hard-won. Humans are linked through a series of interconnected networks and tend to have values in common with other members of the network. And by expanding networks constitute an asset that can be considered as a form of capital. Obviously, the more people get to know each other and the more common outlook is found within them, we'll have a richer social capital. On this basis, this research will examine social capital in two dimensions, cultural (types of the trust) and structural (social participation and emotional and material support of network).

						<title>Economic analysis of contractual breach sanctions</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1754&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of any contract aims at implementation of the obligations arising from it. Morality dictates that people adhere to what they assumed regarding others. The law also supported the moral judgment and in case of breach of obligations to oblige, compensation as a sanction is imposed on obligor. In view of the economic analysis, he also committed to respect his contract and the Contract shall be performed contrary to the intention of breaching party, and on both sides the effectiveness is motivated to build trust and to maximize contract efficiency. Typically there are two basic solutions in compensation for breach of contract. First, the obligation of obligator to perform obligation, secondly, payment of damages for non-performance, either by the parties in the form of penalty clause or by the court to refer the matter to the expert identified and they are required to pay it. In choosing one of these, economic perspective considers the economic benefits of each of these two solutions. If so economic benefit in cases where subjective commitment and intellectual damage on the implementation of the commitment, as compensation for these losses not compensated correctly, and basically cannot be estimated. In second view, sentence in view of the compensation usually refers to material damages or economic damages, in such cases compensation for losses caused to the obligee can be compensated better and more efficient method is considered. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the purpose of signing the contract because is its implementation and in cases where the performance of contractual obligations under changed circumstances faced hardships, the elimination of obstacles to the implementation of the contract will be resolved, it seems to modify the contract as a mechanism for the implementation of the contract must be considered unless they agreed to be imposed on them by law or judicial authority. In this case, unless the modification is done by mutual consent, it is modification by legal and judicial means economically, we'll see how the parties to the agreement have wanted to do risk allocation or choose the more efficient ones, that is, which party can a lower cost can bear the risk of changing circumstances and consider same party responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Practical Step towards Sampling in Qualitative Research; Focused on Grounded Theory</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=1757&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=fa</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a growing trend towards qualitative research in different areas of academic investigations. However, students face difficulties in deciding on qualitative methods of research, because most of the literature on qualitative research focuses on the philosophical and theoretical aspects, and they hardly offer any practical guidelines. This problem is rooted in the essence of qualitative research, which makes the details of the research process unachievable at the beginning. As a result, the features of the sampling plan&amp;mdash;like the accurate size and form of the sampling&amp;mdash;remain uncertain until after the data has been gathered, and this makes the jury doubtful about the approval of the research proposal. Hence, framing an appropriate and assayable plan for sampling can be of great help in the approval and execution of qualitative research plans. From this perspective, the present article aims to design a framework for a sampling plan in qualitative researches using theoretical sources of the grounded theory method and researchers&amp;rsquo; suggestions based on practical involvement, as well as the recent experience of the authors in grounded theory research. By studying these sources, and considering the feedback for and practical involvement in the grounded theory method, a two-stage plan of sampling is proposed. The initial stage aims to ensure adequate diversity for the appropriate distribution of the samples, and the second, as a theoretical sampling stage, guarantees the theoretical attribute of sampling in qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;
