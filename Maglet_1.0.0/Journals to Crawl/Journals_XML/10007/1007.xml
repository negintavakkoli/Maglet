Ports are of major gates of spatial flows. These nodes not only guide the distribution of goods within the supply chain, but also play an important role for developing their hinterlands. Lack of attention to these spatial relationships, especially in countries with endogenous development factors, reduces the importance of local hinterlands. This would also shrink the relations among ports and hinterlands at the local and regional scales. In this regard, identifying and highlighting the components of spatial structure lead to strengthen the relations between ports and hinterlands. Up to now, many articles have been written on Ports and Hinterlands that can be generally classified them into five categories: The role of ports and hinterlands within the supply chain and transportation; function and efficiency of ports; port-city relationships; management, policy-making, and governance of port-regions; and the trajectory of spatial structure of ports, hinterlands, and forelands. This study aims at identifying and weighing the factors of spatial structures and proposing an appropriate theoretical framework on the spatial structure of port-hinterland based on content analysis. The findings suggest six components of spatial structure: territory; node; corridor; activity area; interaction; and discipline. Compilation of these components result new dimensions of spatial structure; such as spatial movement, spatial use and spatial form. Furthermore, during the development of port-hinterland relationships logistic spaces come into being, which enrich the flows of production, distribution, and consumption. Spatial movement depends on the relationship between nodes and communities. Also human activities on the land can form spatial use. Spatial form is based on interaction process between spatial movement and spatial use that can be appeared obviously or be hidden. In the regional structure, component of discipline with obvious outward can introduce a new dimension as logistic spaces. In fact, dimension of logistic space makes difference in spatial structure of port-hinterland compared to other spatial structures. Logistic spaces generally export spatial development flows to undeveloped geographical areas and adjust spatial structure of hinterlands. Overall, these dimensions generates a cycle entitled port-hinterland spatial structure, which can influence the entire spatial structure of a country.

Nowadays, more and more cities into the development process and the physical dimensions of the human desire and her features have faded. The result is fragmentation of man's relationship with his place in particular and the city in general. Thus, the lower part of the city considers its citizens. It does not feel belong; the consequences of which a range of problems such as loss of identity crisis takes responsibility; Aimed to assess the effectiveness of a sense of citizenship with an emphasis on meaning component which has been developed by adopting descriptive and ethnography. This index is based on library studies and documents. In Likert questionnaire was designed using SPSS software test and analysis of different AHP is hierarchical. The results show that social interaction can mean the places affected by the measures in place, individual characteristics, and mental structures; and culture and the formation of a sense of place including indicators, satisfaction and attachment.

The effect of light in Islamic architecture is very important. Its importance and spread is undeniable. It is an important factor in making mosque space spirituality heightened. Light is one of the affecting parameters on the value of space as the most non-material sensible element of nature which is always present in Iranian Islamic architecture. It always creates a mystical atmosphere in the place, especially religious places. In the past Iranian architecture, the application of light always comes with special elegance which improves the quality of the atmosphere of the architecture. Today, the attitude of the quantification and semantic aspects being ignored in the design of spaces often has caused to design light to provide the light needed for the reduction of physical activity. The purpose of writing this article is the introduction of quality assessment methods based on the seven principles of the light from the verse of light of the holy QURAN.

The present research methods for logical argument based on analytical descriptive and based on the field observations and library resources; The main findings of the research are as follows: a) introduction of qualitative principles of the light based on the verse of light, b) introduction of qualitative principles of the light in architectural body of religious spaces, c) introduction of objective and qualitative principles of light in religious spaces, d) introduction of the information extraction method for investigation and understanding of strength and weaknesses of the light in creation of spiritual spaces.

The world is a wide book which pages are full of its author's words and just like Quran inspirational text has multiple meaning levels. The basis of this perception from Quran leads to the deepest understanding of the nature of natural faces and the quality of unity dominated on the world. The main issue in this writing is that firstly how the geometric proportions of the creation is form monotheism Quran principle?; And secondly how the geometric proportions of the creation manifested in the Islamic art and architecture works. The methodology of the research is descriptive, analytic and comparative by trend on Quran resources. The method of data analysis is deductive reasoning. The purpose of this writing is to perceive the heavens cosmos life and approach to the by the of Sobhanallah, refers to God's perfect trailts unexampled and rejection of creatures traits from God, operational monotheism by the slogan Alhamdolellah, refers to worshiping God and its importance and action monotheism by the slogan of Allah Akbar, refers to geometric proportions of the creation and unity and coordination in the existence system.

Traditionally places of worship, the most ultimate bed and the spiritual evolution of mankind and the spiritual and sacred architecture believers has created a platform for collective worship. In between and among religions and social aspects highlighted that place of worship in Islam are created for the collective worship, is of utmost importance. That's why researchers and experts in Islamic architecture reviews and attitude to religious monuments, numerous methods have been used. So that each of theorists over time with different attitudes have interpreted the phenomenon of Islamic architecture; It is important to note that phenomenology in the process of cognitive reasoning and thinking power is sufficient. In contrast, the scholar of Islamic architecture in addition to enjoying the look of contemplation wisdom and knowledge of Islamic law to become liturgical architecture; this study philosophy and phenomenology, reviews and analysis in this way is recognition of religious monuments. The research method is qualitative and descriptive - analysis. In the case of religious buildings in Iran; and the results of this paper, readings from sacred component in the structure and form of worship as the notion of sacred buildings in the design of places of worship. Thus, the analytical findings of this paper is to identify factors that influence led promoting Iranian mosques architecture and how the presence of these components in the architecture of mosques and archetypes is schematically presented and analyzed; The process leading to the search for quality has been analyzed in this article; that more than anything in the promotion of the fundamental components in different parts of the mosque convenience.

Nowadays, the physical impact of the environment on human behavioral pattern has been accepted. Given that one of the most influential factors in the quality of the physical environment, architecture, the importance of tutorial system architecture, defined as a system for raising the architects, will be determined. Overcoming the problems of the current system of architectural education in Iran has always been a concern of researchers and scholars. So far different strategies and educational approaches to solve problems of the educational system or parts of it have been proposed. In many cases these strategies defined in the translation of educational approaches abroad. That it does not comply with existing structures architectural education in which part of the issues have been considered. In order to resolve the issues raised and given the multifaceted nature of endogenous development approach; In this paper the possibility of taking advantage of the potential of this development model, to promote and to address issues and problems facing the educational system have been investigated and using simulation and logical argument research method defines conceptual models of the topics discussed and Finally, principles and components of this architectural education approach adopted.

The methodology of this study was descriptive of survey and the tool for survey consisted of a questionnaire. In this research, the components of environmental culture based on library study, review of documents, official reports, national and international sources as well as interviews with environmental experts was prepared; Statistical group involving 260 managers and experts of nuclear industry in field related to environmental issues. The validity of the questionnaire developed by the researcher was approved by the relevant academicians and its stability was calculated as equivalent to 0.88 using the Cronbach alpha formula. The results of the study showed that the total score of environmental culture in the nuclear industry has been positive and percent of employees with positive environment culture, equivalent to 71.7 and percent of employees with negative environment culture, equivalent to 28.3. This research also indicates that there was no significant difference between environmental culture and gender of employees, but the average environmental culture of employees increased with the increasing level of education, job rating and work experience. Besides, the results taking into account the effects of three parameters level of education, job rating and work experience simultaneously on environmental culture have shown that the impact of work experience and job rating is higher than the impact of level of education. This due to the national nuclear industry interaction with the international atomic energy agency and various training courses held by the international atomic energy agency for managers and experts with higher work experience.
