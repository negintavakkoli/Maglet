		<Abstract>Recent growth and developments in internet and electronic services play a significant role in banking industry all over the world especially in Iran. It caused an intensive competition between governmental and non- governmental banks in the field of using e-banking services in a way that each bank attempts to attract more customers using high-quality e-services. Ways of delivering services, quality of services and specifications of e-banking services have direct relationship with tendencies and orientations of customers in using e-banking services. This fact also affects satisfaction and loyalty of customers. In this situation, customers will be more high-expected for receiving e-services in higher quality. By investigating e-banking literature; authors discovered lack of a comprehensive model for evaluating different aspects of e-banking services. As a result, the purpose of this research is to deeply explore the broad literature and to identify the most significant factors and indicators in evaluating the quality of e-banking services. Then by defining fuzzy set of factors affecting the selection of e-banking services which includes quality of service and trust, ease of use, responsiveness, information quality and also defining fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy rules, a comprehensive fuzzy inference system is provided so as to evaluate the tendency to use of e-banking services for Iranian banks. Finally satisfaction of e-banking services in Sepah bank as the first Iranian bank is evaluated through the model developed in this research.</Abstract>
