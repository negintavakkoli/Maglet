Chivalry principles, in Islamic period, are based on the pure nature of manliness and its origin and orientation goes back to Imams and prophets. By obeying and adherence to these principles, which have been called as Chivalry principles, people were categorized as the Chivalry. These mores have also been common in other countries such as Iraq, Anatoly, and todays&amp;rsquo; Syria. In early Islamic period, Chivalry mores was only peculiar to some specific people, but as the time passed guilds also founded some rules based on Chivalry, which must have been obeyed by volunteers willing to join that guild. The place and footprint of mores and etiquettes of chivalrous people in Islamic architecture works were studied in this research. To do this, Chivalry appearances in the architecture of Islamic period buildings investigated. Relying on the comparative and analytical reasoning between the moral principles of the Chivalry and the Islamic architectural works, some results were gained. Some of them are the existence of internal spaces, taken from the idea of confidentiality of the Chivalry and leaving the doors shorter in Islamic architecture of some structures like Zurkhaneh (gymnasium), to illustrate the humility and modesty while entering into such places. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
