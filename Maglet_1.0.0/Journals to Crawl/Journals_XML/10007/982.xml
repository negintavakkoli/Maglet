	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;This study&amp;rsquos goal is determining the accurate relationship of central bank with its environment through recognizing the conditions of this bank in four aspects of autogeny(internal authority), heterogeny (interaction), discretion(influence in environment) and detachment (organization self usage of it's resources) . This study is discovery and survey in terms of method. Collecting data tool is questionnaire. After Delphi bike, detachment variable was removed in final questionnaire and for autogeny 10 questions, heterogeny 11 and discretion 17 were designed so it can be said that content and facial validity of questionnaire are confirmed. Since Cronbach&amp;rsquos alpha coefficient was higher than 0.7, it showed acceptable reliability of questionnaire. For analyzing data SPSS and MATLAB software were used. Results showed that there is a significant difference between ideal situation of central bank&amp;rsquos conditions in Iran 2025 with existing situation in all three aspects of autogeny, heterogeny and discretion. There has also been significant relationship among each one of aspects of autogeny, heterogeny and discretion in ideal situation and existing one. In autogeny aspect, experts&amp;rsquo mean was more than population&amp;rsquos mean which showed that central bank&amp;rsquos autogeny in Iran 2025 should be increased compared to current status. In heterogeny aspect, experts&amp;rsquo mean was less than population&amp;rsquos mean and it represented that central bank&amp;rsquos heterogeny in current situation is more than what it should be and central bank should decrease its heterogeny with environment in future. In discretion aspect, experts&amp;rsquo mean was more than population&amp;rsquos mean and so central bank&amp;rsquos discretion is needed to be increased in Iran 2025 compared to current status.  &lt;/p&gt;
