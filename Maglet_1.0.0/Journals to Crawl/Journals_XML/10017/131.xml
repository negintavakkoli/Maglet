			<abstract>Organizations are designing structures by creating internal relationships and order to fulfill their intrinsic mission. Regarding the complexity and environmental uncertainty, there are several factors that influence the development of the structure of military organizations as important proponents. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the important factors on the structure of military organizations for understanding And the overall picture, explanation and prediction of the changing variables, for proper structuring and structure, and enhancement of organizational capability. The statistical population consisted of military military organizations and a sample of 200 experts from this field. The validity of the questionnaire was obtained by approved military management professors and reliability was calculated by calculating Cronbach&#039;s alpha of 0.84. For this research, with the study of more than 100 different sources, 28 indicators were extracted exploratively. These 28 indicators were reduced by using the mapping and factor analysis technique to 24 main indexes and were classified into 4 hidden factors respectively The most variances, including the orientation element, the international environment, the required capabilities and the general environment, were categorized and Friedman test ranked the indexes. Against this ranking, the first major indicator of &quot;threat diversity&quot; and the latest indicator of &quot;infectious diseases, natural disasters and global warming&quot; was achieved.</abstract>

			<abstract>Given the importance of the supply chain for gaining competitive advantage, competition between organizations is said to have been replaced by competition between supply chains. Therefore, supply chain Effective management is a key factor in the success of the organization. Disruptions as the outcome of unexpected events are an inseparable part of the supply chain of today&#039;s organizations operating in conditions of uncertainty. A resiliency approach in supply chain management has been introduced to deal with these unexpected events in the supply chain and to improve it quickly and return it to its original state before the occurrence of the event. The role of defense products in enhancing deterrence against military threats, well shows up the importance and necessity of applying a resilient approach to supply chain management of defense industries. In this paper, with the aim of developing a defense industry supply chain resonance model, we first identified the most important supply chain resilience practices, then classified them using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and then, using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) provides a model that illustrates the relationship between these actions. The power of driving and dependence of practices are also analyzed using the MICMAC technique. The results of the research show that out of a total of 37 practices introduced in the previous research for the resilient supply chain, 19 practices are effective in the resilient supply chain of defense industries. It consists of 5 categories and includes: Relationship with the suppliers, Flexibility, Agility, Redundancy and Security. Relationship with the suppliers as the most basic and most driving practice and Agility, Redundancy and Security are the most dependent practices of the defense industries resilient supply chain. Therefore, managers first of all should focus on effectively communicating with suppliers in order to enhance supply chain resilience.</abstract>

			<abstract>The purpose of this research is to identify barriers of defensive technological innovative system managment. The present study population consisted of researchers, faculty members, experts and experts in military technology. 100 of them were identified and 80 were selected by simple random sampling method. The research instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire. In order to ensure the validity of the questionnaire, experts suggestion and recommendation were used for the questionnaires&#039; and the ordering of the questions. Cronbach&#039;s alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.98. The results of one-dimensional t-test showed that defensive notification policies, innovation capacity, operational dimension of innovation, and knowledge, tactics and defense theories are the main prerequisites for defensive technological innovative system managment. The results showed that barriers of policies, barriers of innovation capacity, barriers of operational dimension of innovation, and knowledge, tactics and defense theories barriers of innovation, barriers of sensemaking, barriers of design ,barriers of technology &amp;,barriers of knowledge breakthrough are the most important dimensions and main variables of the identifying barriers of defensive technological innovative system management.</abstract>

			<abstract>The armed forces of each country, must always be prepared to deal with the enemy&#039;s invasion. For this reason, they must maintain their combat readiness by conducting military exercises. Military exercises are the best military exercises to deal with war conditions. A military exercise is conducted in a specific process and with presence of various military units in a specific territorial area. The goal of military exercises is to achieve educational goals at high levels with the maximum presence of all types of military forces. In this research, the problem of locating military units in the ground of exercise and the problem of deployment and counter-deployment in format of bi-level mathematical program are discussed. In this research, the Regional Headquarters is considered as the first level (leader) and the participating units (brigades) in exercise as the second level (follower), regarding that more than one unit is participating in the exercise, we deal with a multi-follower problem. The results of modeling and solving the model showed that if the principles used in this paper were used, selecting the appropriate place to conduct and selecting the appropriate place for each participant in the resume was done more desirable and more scientifically. Also, deployment and counter-deployment of the military equipment and military forces will be done With better control and time management, and if necessary, outsourcing will take place. Therefore, the use of scientific solutions in logistics planning is recommended.</abstract>
