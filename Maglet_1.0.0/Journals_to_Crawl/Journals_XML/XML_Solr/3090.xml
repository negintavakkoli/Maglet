In this regard, the present research attempted to identify and present the characteristics and capabilities of ideal leaders from the viewpoint of followers.

Exploratory blended research strategy was selected and used as a contractual content analysis tool. The texts of the interviews were compiled, had been written and coded, and then categories and themes were extracted; the results of coding and data analysis were classified into two themes of positive prototypes and negative prototypes. In the lowest level, ۲۸ units of thoughts were discovered. Categories for positive pre-models include «charismatic» , «humanistic» , «committed to securing,» «emotional maturity,» «high decision-making power,» and for negative patterns of titles, «self-protecting» , «deceitful» and «narrow».
