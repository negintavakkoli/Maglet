		<Abstract>This study aimed to provide a model representation with Grounded Theory approach for Nature Schools Development in Iran. The present research is applied in terms of &quot;purpose&quot; and in terms of the data type, &quot;qualitative&quot; and in terms of the &quot;Grounded Theory&quot;(systematic version) implementation. The data of this study were the result of semi-structured interview with the participation of 15 administrator and facilitator of nature schools and study document of 2 specialists on the subject who are selected through theoretical and purposeful sampling. Interview data were analyzed in three stages of open, axial and selective coding. The result confirmed the reliability index and reliability between the two coders. The study findingswere first categorized in 78 major categories and then in 23 main categories and then in six components of the proposed paradigm model, proposed by Strauss and Corbin. The central phenomenon of &quot;determining legal place&quot; is the core of the development of nature schools in Iran. The other components and categories include Causal conditions: &quot;cultural and social context”, “changing society&#039;s point of view and policy makers towards children&quot;, &quot; Belief and common sense &quot;, &quot; Knowing the importance of nature experience at early ages &quot;, &quot;understanding necessity of Preservation environmental protection &quot;,&quot; Education ministry supportive policies &quot;; Context conditions include:&quot; religious and cultural foundations &quot;,&quot; administrative barrier system &quot;and&quot; life style and urbanization and  Intervening factors include: &quot;financial Facilities and funds,&quot; &quot;Material and spiritual support of the people,&quot; &quot;Infrastructure and physical space,&quot; &quot; Human Resources Empowerment &quot;; Action/interaction strategies includes: &quot; Expansion and discovery mechanism &quot;, &quot; Cooperation of media&quot;,&quot; Promotion the sense of nature school &quot;,&quot; Learning out of experiences &quot;and&quot; Professional requirement of facilitators&quot;,&quot; active societies of the child&#039;s sphere &quot;,&quot; setting standards of safety and health &quot;and the component of the consequence: &quot; Individual Consequences &quot;, and &quot; Social &amp; economic Consequences &quot;.Frequent outdoor experiences and contact with nature strengthen children’s empathic relationship to nature, and are essential for a later connection with and care for the environment. Despite this fact, children in urban environments are frequently kept apart from nature and isolated from the dangers of the outside world: traffic, violence, strangers, rain and cold. There is a decline in outdoor games, in-and out-of-school, and urban spaces rarely have green areas where children can freely experience direct contact with nature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The recent study in the prospect of data type is called quality and the way of operation is named systematic. The founder in this project has used Strauss and Corbin patterns. The tool in which this project is done is semi-organized interview till the elements and symbols totally discovered. Mots the questions are toward organized and followed the trend the discovery was looking for. The founder followed coral quizzes. Participants were selected among Administrator, facilitators and the experts who were master on nature school subject. Because the sampling criterion in this study is rather than the number of individuals and groups nature is the subject and situation in which research is conducted. Theoretical sampling is the process of data collection for generation of theory whereby the researcher jointing collect next and where to find them, in order to develop the theory as it emerges. The process of data collection is controlled by the emerging theory, whether substance or formal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The general aim of this project is presenting a model in nature schools and is following 6 main goals: 1. Identification Central phenomenon of nature schools development in Iran 2. Identification causal conditions of nature schools development in Iran 3. Identification expansion context of nature schools development in Iran 4. Identification intervening factors recognition of nature schools development in Iran 5. Identification action/interaction strategies of nature schools development in Iran 6. Possible consequences of nature schools development in Iran. This study has not been linear and is in the process of data analysis and repetitions. Therefore, the overall process has been comprehensive and gradual. The data were being gathered after each stage and recorded consequently and in the way of data analysis a lot of comparisons were made. Furthermore, 3 coding systems were chosen and the frequency in which participants took part in were gradually questioned relatively. These three types open, axial, and selective. Out of 15 interviews and 2 documents revisions, there was 546 data. This data was coded in 78 categories in level one and in conclusion these definitions were summarized in 23 categories. These categories were coded in paradigm, comprehensive, and background and consequences. In the first stage or to better say, open coding, the data of such this analysis were categorized. Such this act gather the data distractions and make them more meaningful. In fact, the researcher has considered 3 elements for total calculations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In regard with the first aim that we were discussing, the exact role of such these schools in society was found and discussed legally. This aim is achieved because all the elements contributed to the way that they were grown up with. It is needless to say that the growth and expansion in such these schools can only happen if all the organizations cooperate in a sensible way. It is needed to be mentioned that the growth in children must be done from their childhood and if not so they will not learn the exact requirement of a standard life and some negative consequences will be the result. In the recent findings which were done in the year 2013 and opening almost 78 nature schools in Iran. Openers haven’t got any positive results to receive the legal permissions and it caused that after about a year of work or two, they regret their first decision and receive closure letter to renew their contract. As it was discussed in the first pages, in Denmark, a new course of study was made from the first years of 1980 and set the nature schools subject as the priority and learning from nature in open space was named as one of their subjects. In addition in Germany the principals accepted with the idea and now we can see that more and more people now in Iran are getting more interested in this way and subject due to some positive feedbacks they have received.</Abstract>
