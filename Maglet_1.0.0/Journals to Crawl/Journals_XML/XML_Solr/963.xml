Now, measuring the extent of the relative efficiency of this project is an appropriate index for its evaluation. Thus, in the current research, the extent of the efficiency of the cities of Sistan and Balouchestan Province with population of more than ۲۵۰۰۰ in implementing Mehr housing projects over the period of ۲۰۰۸-۲۰۱۱ was measured utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Technique via output-based BCC model. The variables, used as input, were human resources and physical and financial resources, and the outputs were the number of finished buildings and the extent of employment resulting from such a project. The results indicate that Mehr housing project was efficient in such cities as Chabahar, Khash, Zahedan, and Konarak and inefficient in Iranshahr, Zabol, and Saravan. </field></doc></add>
