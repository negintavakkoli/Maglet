	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Studies conducted in the field of behaviour show that the necessity of noticing and determining urban space behaviour in field studies as well as surveys on dynamic small spaces is undeniable. Small urban spaces, including people-oriented spaces, involve social interactions. This study aims to consider the effect of small urban spaces on the volume of people&amp;rsquo;s social interactions and participations. The sample group consists of 184 residents and passers-by in the centre of the Sultan Mir Ahmad neighbourhood on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Information on variables was obtained through the behavioural questionnaire together with the related theoretical analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between behavioural indicators and people&amp;rsquo;s turnout, while the regression model was used to determine the weight of each index. According to the studies, components such as awareness, people, purpose, etc. can be impactful from different perspectives in the incidence of behaviour in urban spaces. It can also identify features of behaviour in urban spaces, which can overall be considered in studies on urban space and behaviourism. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the neighbourhood centres considered in the study; five indicators show the correlation to preferential behaviour ranging from 39% (highest) to 19% (lowest).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
