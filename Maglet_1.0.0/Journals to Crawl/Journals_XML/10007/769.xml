	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Primary man in trying to find food went everywhere. But by forming ranching arranged a chain of places and became emigrant. By happening industrial revolution, human life was centralized on one place.&amp;nbsp; Places that base on its advantages make different biologic and behavioral types. Forming cities in seaboard, river shore, boundary of mountains and Champaign cause to make different cultures that shows habitat and continent effects on their inhabitants. This definition of human means native man was removing in industrial revolution because modern life advantages aren't depended on habitat. Loom factories develop in every longitude and latitude and cause to form cities that have sit on beds without native values. In fact dependency on a special place in agriculture ages lost its special value and come off in everywhere. In the other hand, in information and media revolution of globalization life Advantages Sea themselves in communication and virtual space that is quite placeless. In fact if we define habitat as an interacting situation between human and a place, we can survey this concept evolution and change procedure from past to now and study its results and effects on human life space quality. In this study we survey efficacy on and getting effect of habitat by studying cultural and anthropologic evolution and genesis of habitat concept and restudy its relation with human real and virtual residential space.&lt;/p&gt;
