Current research in terms of purpose is applicable. In terms of data, it is quantitative. In terms of method, it is a descriptive-survey research. In this research, for determining the validity of measurement tool, content validity has been used and for calculating the reliability, Cronbach&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;s Alpha method has been used. The population of this research includes the faculty members and employees of Islamic Azad University in region 8. Also the researcher-made questionnaire has been used for information collection. In this research, a framework consisting of quadratic dimensions of the process management, technology, culture and structure for evaluation of organizational forgetting management was considered. With regard to the comparison by using of the mean index, the quadratic dimensions were evaluated in two eligible and available situations. It is determined that with regard to the difference between two available and eligible situations, in fact the level of process dimension is low and it is in available situation, also it can be concluded that culture in available situation is very posterior than ideal and eligible situation. In two technology and structure dimensions, this mean difference is less than two other dimensions. In available situation, the most gaps and deficits at first exist in culture dimension and then in two technology and structure dimensions; and finally there is weakness in the process dimension. Totally in different dimensions, there is a relatively large difference and gap between the mean indexes of two eligible and available situations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
