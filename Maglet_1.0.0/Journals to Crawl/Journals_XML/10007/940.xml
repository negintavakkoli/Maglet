	<abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of spatial political management is to increase access to social and economic services to all residents in an area in order to enhance their satisfaction. There is a great space in the action that has a broad scope. &amp;nbsp;If the spatial political organization implemented in a country is unable to organize such services in a condensed manner, it will face reduced efficiency and lack of satisfaction of its residents of their access to economic, socio- cultural services, so it will lose its political authority before its residents. The distance between the rural- urban centers of the Great Khorasan province to its capital (Mashhad) along with its consequent complications have always been one of the problems of this Great province before conducting the political divisions of the province in 2004. One of the most significant purposes of assigning the law of the state divisions in the province has been to lower its physical distance to the political center of the province and to increase the socio- economic facilities provided to raise its inhabitants&amp;rsquo; satisfaction. The present reearch was conducted using a descriptive- analytric approach to analyze the effects ofthe state&amp;rsquo;s divisions and to increase the effect of the political centers (Birjand and Bojnord) on thesatisfaction level in terms of economic, socio- cutural needs of the citizens in the North Khorasan province. The resultsshowed that reducing thedistance created in the political divisions of the province and adjacency of the urban rural centers to the political sites in the province has failed satisfying the satisfaction of the local residents of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Urban farms can have the potential to have a great impact on the stability of crowded cities. The purpose of the present study is discovering the effective design-based components in developing urban agriculture in the viewpoint of Tehran&amp;rsquo;s urban managers. It is assumed that the design-based development of urban agriculture improves economic conditions and also food security for Tehran&amp;rsquo;s citizens. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in this research. In the qualitative section of the research, analysis of the influential factors was carried out. Then in order to assess the credibility of the obtained data and obtaining the opinions of the managers, the Delphi method was used. Afterwards, their opinions were gauged and categorized using Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Entropy. The statistical population in this study consisted of 71 city managers and the consultants on designing city spaces who had over 10 years of experience on the job. Quantitative analysis of the data was carried out using the SPSS 22 statistical software. The results showed that establishing and developing design-based urban farming could lead to elevated qualities of environment, food security and economic well-being more than any other factor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Studies conducted in the field of behaviour show that the necessity of noticing and determining urban space behaviour in field studies as well as surveys on dynamic small spaces is undeniable. Small urban spaces, including people-oriented spaces, involve social interactions. This study aims to consider the effect of small urban spaces on the volume of people&amp;rsquo;s social interactions and participations. The sample group consists of 184 residents and passers-by in the centre of the Sultan Mir Ahmad neighbourhood on different days of the week and at different times of the day. Information on variables was obtained through the behavioural questionnaire together with the related theoretical analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between behavioural indicators and people&amp;rsquo;s turnout, while the regression model was used to determine the weight of each index. According to the studies, components such as awareness, people, purpose, etc. can be impactful from different perspectives in the incidence of behaviour in urban spaces. It can also identify features of behaviour in urban spaces, which can overall be considered in studies on urban space and behaviourism. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the neighbourhood centres considered in the study; five indicators show the correlation to preferential behaviour ranging from 39% (highest) to 19% (lowest).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;In most countries, a major source of government revenue is funded through taxes. Tax share of total public revenues is different among countries and the rate depends on the level of development and economic structure. For this reason, the necessity to understanding of causes, aggravating factors, tax evasion, providing practical solutions and scientific recommendations will be inevitable. According to the current study by using a smooth transition regression (STR) and annual data from 1971-2015, we investigate the effects of direct financing through amendments of direct tax law on economic growth in Iran's conventional model of economic growth. The results of this study, along with the theoretical foundations and the prevailing belief of most economists, showed that the effect of different methods of financing through direct taxes on economic growth in Iran conditional on the state of the economy, in particular in accordance with the results of investment. It means that in the first regime, when the investment share of GDP is became less than 34/05 percent, financed by oil revenues has negative effects and finan&lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cing through tax revenues had a positive effect on economic growth. But in the second regime, when the investment share of GDP is more than 28/01 percent, the financing of both oil and tax revenues had a positive effect on economic growth. Although in the second regime and by increasing the investment to keep pace with positive impact on the severity funded through tax revenues increased.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Human is a compatible creature with the ability to grow the modern knowledge and new patterns of activity. Social pressures and cultural norms could affect formation of behavioral patterns and attitudes of urban planners. However, the framework is not static and could be changed over the time and the urban planners are responsible for controlling, conducting and evaluating the reflection of these changes and playing role in their formation. It should be noted that with such speed of changes in the current cities, realization of a degree of flexibility if required and the future prospects could clear flexible and creative cities as the contexts for economic, social and cultural development of societies and urban spaces could be important sites to meet needs of citizens and formation of social activities. Now in this study, which is a descriptive-analytical research in terms of nature, the main objective is to recognize required components in formation of flexible urban space in Iran and to measure the perceptions and expectations of flexible urban spaces in Iran. It should be mentioned that achievement of these spaces with flexibility capabilities needs firstly some preconditions including accessibility, diversity and readability. In this regard, at the first, qualitative data are collected using library method and the literature is reviewed to identify the most important components involved in formation of flexible urban space and then, the data are measured in frame of Delphi Method. Then, to clear the differences between expectations and perceptions, a questionnaire is used for paired mean comparison of components. Due to the difference between the existing and expected conditions, this issue was confirmed. Finally, for better understanding of the difference and using the gap scatter plot, relevant factors of physical system and energy were placed in the part of balanced and fixed factors, factors related to spatial and functional system and meeting needs of citizens as the problem and relevant factors of formation process and role of citizens in growth balance were observed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;the aim of this study is explaining the relationship between social trust with citizenship ethic. The study population consisted of all high school students in Bushehr city that among this population, a sample of 360 students were selected by multistage random sampling method. the research tools included multi dimension comparison of recognized social support, questionnaire of social trust and citizens ethics questionnaire. To analyze the data, statistical methods such as Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used. Pearson correlation coefficients showed that between Social trust and its dimension such as trust-based behavior, cooperative tendencies, openness, honesty and reliability has significantly relationship with ethics. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between aspects of social trust with citizen&amp;rsquo;s ethics. Predictor variables explain 22% variance of ethical citizens among high school students in Bushehr city. Among the predictor variables the cooperative intentions was the best &amp;nbsp;predictive of citizens ethics and at the end the suggestions and necessary solutions were presented.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Applied studies addressing semi-rigid connections have been limited. Scant information exists in regulations except little brief information. Therefore, this research analyzes the behavior of three-dimensional steel frames and semi-rigid connections based on beam-column method and non-linear dynamic analysis. Stability functions and geometric stiffness matrix were used to study the non-linear geometric behavior of members. Then the dynamic behavior of rotational springs was simulated by stiffening, and the non-linear load-displacement responses and the final results were compared to prior studies that have taken place. It was finally concluded that the method used to analyze the semi-rigid connections was efficient, and if one element per member is used and a precise monitoring is delivered, end sections and nonlinear steel frames behavior with semi-rigid connections can be predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Study of natural hazards can be a useful tool in decision-making, planning and prioritization of measures to manage the crisis. In this research, the details of this approach in Astaneh Ashrafieh district in northern Iran in Gilan Province were evaluated and described given the history of liquefaction in the earthquake in Rudbar and Manjil in 1990. According to GSI maps of Sefidrud delta sediments in which Astaneh Ashrafieh area is located, the area from Paykouh to the beach mostly belongs to the Quaternary. At the delta level, there are three stratigraphic units related to the Pleistocene and five units related to the Holocene. In this study, more than 50 boreholes were drilled and a borehole for analysis was analyzed at the most critical parts of the region. Type of drilling in the study was machine-rotating and continuous sampling was conducted to a depth of 18 meters at a depth. Underground water level for this purpose was 3 meters and using experiments, research work began on the sand of the area, sand of the area was tested by ​​field and laboratory studies such as on-site testing, grading test, and chemical and mineralogical tests. Based on the tests, sediments were mainly made of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and epidote minerals, a little quartz and carbonate debris and contained circular and semi-circular particulars and a small amount of clay and in some areas, silt in the surface layers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Biology has been a brilliant teacher and a precious textbook to man-made construction for thousands of years, because it allows one to learn and be inspired by nature&amp;rsquo;s remarkable and efficient structural systems. Concepts unfortunately have this in common that in general use often specifies incorrectly some phenomena. There was a turning point in each period of time which human has discovered a new sight about the world and nature order in a way, and then has presented this relation by numeral, artful and industrial language. The relation between nature and human considers different periods. At first it was bio-utilization which degrades the value of nature as a source of energy and material. After revolution in science development and attention to the damages which they made to environment, they tried to change their look to this issue and expand the mean of relation between human and nature. Birth of such word like bio architecture emphasize on the new point of view at nature. The role of nature and importance of natural resources in human&amp;rsquo;s social-economic (and even his psychological) life is undeniable, and also it is essential to note that God is the Creator and man the explorer. This paper aims to call a close multidisciplinary collaboration that promotes engineers to build more sustainable and smart structural systems for bridges in the 21st century.

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The present study has been done to provide a model to promote organizational health in University of Applied Science and Technology. It is a descriptive survey. Statistical population were 5639 people and 700 people were chosen as a sample by random stratified sampling and they were examined by the researcher-developed questionnaire. To determine content validity of the questionnaire, the review of literature and experts opinion were excerpted; experimental implementation has been applied to determine face validity; and factor analysis was used to estimate construct validity, on the other hand, Cronbach&amp;alpha; was 0.795 which show reliability of the instrument. However, the status quo is lower than the average in all the mentioned components at Applied Science and Technology University. The conceptual model of study that include 19 components and 32 mechanisms has been developed, also the degree of model fitness has been judged by experts.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Following the creation of economic, social and environmental issues in metropolises, strategies aimed to build new cities to decentralize, attract the overflow of crowed population and reduce its activity, in order to enhance the quality of life and to organize the population and activity in urban areas. In the present study, the role of spatial planning for new towns in the metropolitan suburbs of Mashhad or in other words, the role of these new towns on the space balance, creating the employment and self-sufficiency and to absorb some part of Mashhad&amp;rsquo;s population has been studied. In this regard, in addition to the library studies and comparisons of existing status with the predicted targets for studying new cities, two series of questions regarding the condition of every new town, as well as analysis network process (ANP) were used to assess their success and to rank them. Results showed that the infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s indicator plays the greatest role in the success or failure of these cities in achieving their goals, so if the government does not provide the platform and infrastructure, new towns policy does not help resolve the crisis of metropolitans. After infrastructure, employment, attraction of people and accessibility have almost equally important and are in secondary importance. Eventually, our results revealed that Gulbahar has been more successful than Binalud, According to the results of the present study, the coordinated and proper management at national and regional levels, especially in the Mashhad conurbation, creation of employment opportunities, improving the identify and the quality of new towns and provide appropriate services is necessary and&amp;nbsp; essential to citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The issue under women&amp;rsquo;s involvement or lack of involvement in political and social activities refers to one of the most controversial issues to which a large body of scientific efforts and discussions has allocated. One of these activities includes tenure of religious authority by women which is of great importance due to abundant outcomes. The present research intends to examine juridical exploration in women&amp;rsquo;s urban management contribution. This research has indicated using library study, descriptive-analytical method and data collection via note taking instruments that there is no convincing reason to disturb the tenure of religious authority by women, and as a result we perceive using evidence to attribute authority of women and/or the condition to not know gender in issuing&lt;em&gt; fatwas that women like men can enjoy the urban management. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle which encompasses social,&amp;nbsp;cultural, and economic&amp;nbsp;factors deeply impacts upon the people's behavioral patterns and mental attitudes.&amp;nbsp;One of the manifestations of&amp;nbsp;lifestyle is&amp;nbsp;the quality of selecting living&amp;nbsp;places,&amp;nbsp;which in turn influences&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;architecture&amp;nbsp;of the houses. &amp;nbsp; The purpose of the present study is to examine the extent to which modern lifestyle affected Hamadanian people`s lifestyle as well as the architecture of their houses during the first Pahlavi regime. The study adopted a historical-interpretive analytical method which describes the modern lifestyle of Hamedanian people by taking the transition from tradition to modernity into account and investigates the conceptual components of the architectural modernism of the houses using&amp;nbsp;architectural space analysis.&amp;nbsp;The data for the study were collected through library resources and field study. The sampling method for the field study was purposive.&amp;nbsp;To this end, all the houses built during the first Pahlavi regime which had documents and were possible to visit for a filed study were examined. The results provided evidence for the modernization of people`s lifestyle which led to &amp;nbsp;new concepts of&amp;nbsp;modern&amp;nbsp;lifestyle,&amp;nbsp;such as consumerism, the development of social interaction, the initial formation of civility, social distinction and status, and&amp;nbsp;social&amp;nbsp;importance of&amp;nbsp;women.&amp;nbsp;Moreover, the findings show that changes in lifestyle resulted in&amp;nbsp;the formation of&amp;nbsp;three different architectural patterns. Garden houses,&amp;nbsp;street houses, and evolved traditional houses were considered as reflections of architectural changes. These evolutions show the changes in people`s lifestyle&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;as a result of transition from tradition to modernity&amp;nbsp; and the evolution of architectural space due to the changes in the quality of modernism style of life.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;After demonstrating Ottoman Empire and attempt of Turkish emperors in order to gain caliphate and government of all Muslims, World&amp;rsquo;s political geography witnessed the demonstration of great Ottoman Empire for six months. The formation of Ottoman Empire, on one hand, was converted to the main axis of the political geography of the region, and started competing with other political power districts of the world on the other hand. This went on for ages. By the end of the world war first, the world&amp;rsquo;s political formation was altered and the disintegration of the great Ottoman caliphate occurred by Sykes-Picot agreement in 1917 and this led to the beginning of the advent of a new political geography. By getting into power, Turkish Islamists caused a new era in the region&amp;rsquo;s political geography in 2002. New neo- ottoman idea with the aim of changing the political geography of the region is included to be one of the most important political events of the region. In this paper, by having a quick look at the record of Ottoman Empire, we are going to focus on the new strategy of Turkish AKP and inspect the effect of the strategy on changing the political geography of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Light and lighting encompass different dimensions of urban life, thus the harmony and coordination of this process with environment and urban space is of great importance. Due to the importance of mental patterns in urban planning, present article analyzes the relation between mental dimensions of lighting and the spatial improvement of Tehran metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present article is developmental and applied in objectives and uses a descriptive-analytic method. At the same time, it takes advantage of statistical techniques such as factor analysis, correlation, t test and regression. The investigations indicate that lighting influences 3 different parameters, tourism, safety, attractiveness of the environment. Undoubtedly, the quality of urban lighting is considered to be especially important in attracting citizens to these textures. Therefore, it is necessary to improve lighting quality in the process of designing our urban textures. Findings show that the residents of the case study area have a low level of satisfaction regarding the quality of lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Youth participation in planning and design process in their living environments is an important issue that has significant impact on young participants, the community, spaces and places where they live. So, using their participation in the evaluation of youth friendly environmental quality indicators can lead to the creation of desirable urban spaces for them. After developing indicators on the basis of theoretical foundations of adolescent-friendly environments, this study attempts, to assess the importance of the indicators from 15 to 18-year-old adolescents&amp;rsquo; view in making an ideal city, in Rasht Golsar district and to find that to what extent their living environments have been successful in meeting these measures. Research method, has been descriptive-analytic and theoretical foundations through library and teenagers&amp;rsquo; view analysis with a combination approach was carried out through two questionnaires, focus group discussions and map anchored interviews. For this purpose, quantitative data analysis software method Excel and Spss and qualitative data analysis was conducted using content analysis. The results show that the studied indicators are very important for teens and most of these indicators has no place in their living environments.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Score for exposure factor is the sum of scores for the five criteria of precipitation, temperature, wind, weather phenomena, and horizontal visibility. Hourly data on precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, weather condition codes, and horizontal visibility obtained at 23 synoptic stations in the Province, and from those located in an area within a radius of 100 kilometers from the borders of it, since the time they were established up to the end of 2012, was first received from Iran Meteorological Organization. Those stations were then selected that had data related to eight daily measurements in the interval 1990-2010. Based on this, data processing was carried out for nine stations (five in Kermanshah Province and four in neighboring Provinces) within MATLAB environment. The scores for exposure factors for climate change in two five-year intervals were calculated to assess climate vulnerability of Kermanshah Province. In the next stage, the study period was divided into three intervals: the base interval (from 23, 9, 1990 to 21, 9, 2000), the first interval (from 22, 9, 2000 to 22, 9, 2005), and the second interval (from 23, 9, 2005 to 22, 9, 2010). Following that, exposure criteria and markers were determined. It was then necessary to define and measure a broad range of markers because of the temporal-spatial non-uniformity in the climate of Kermanshah Province that results from land location and variety in this Province. In the present research, climatic data was processed in the framework of five criteria that included 29 markers. In general, it was found that Kermanshah Province is faced with increased hazards resulting from current changes in climate.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental presumptions of management audit shows that change in costs is in fir correlation with increase and decrease in activity level. However, this assumption is discussed with considering the cost stickiness by Anderson et al. it means that the amount of increase in costs with the increase in activity level is more than reduction in costs per same amount of reduction in activity level. On the other hand, audit could increase the reliability of information available for the users and with the increase in audit quality; quality of information is also enhanced. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of audit quality on cost stickiness in manufacturing companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange. Statistical population of this study consists of companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2007 to 2014. To measure the correlation of research variables, Pearson correlation test is used and finally, to test research hypotheses, generalized ordinary least-squares regression is used. The results obtained from testing hypotheses how that size of audit and audit tenure (more than 3 years) could affect cost stickiness positively and significantly. However, the expertise of auditor in the industry and importance of a company for a audit institution could have no effect on cost stickiness.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The objective of present study was to identify and evaluate the organizational structure of agile universities. The research method was mixed (qualitative-quantitative). Statistical populations in the qualitative section consisted of 18 researchers in the field of organizational agility and were selected by purposive sampling method. Statistical society in quantitative section consisted of 150 members of the faculty of management at the University units of Mazandaran province. These subjects have been teaching in the universities at least for 10 years. Stratified random sampling was done considering the size of the faculty members in each college. The sample size was 90 people calculated based on Cochran Formula. Data collection tools in qualitative section were semi-structured interviews and questionnaire respondents agreed determining factor in the quantitative part questionnaire had 25 questions drawn from the results of the interviews. This question has two dimensions and evaluated the existing and desired agile organizational structure. In the qualitative data analysis methods, using the technique of open coding, axial, and selective and Kendall test showed agreement among experts; In the quantitative data analyses using descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The qualitative findings stage of the existence of qualitative show there are 7 factors and 25 indexes. Kendall's coefficient of agreement for the issue of the right size were (0.72), improving the organizational level (0.66) decreased organizational formalities, (0.67), effective communication, (0.69) now and integration (0.61) the center of decision-making (0.67) and the improvement of human resources. So these concepts were introduced as aspects of organizational structure. The findings of this assessment indicate that between the status quo and the ideal situation is marked on all sides there is a significant difference. Most of this difference in the dimensions of formalization and the lowest levels in the structure; According to the strategy managers and planners Islamic Azad University about creating agile university research findings can provide special approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is to investigate in-store antecedents and consequences experiences on Hyperstar Stores. There were investigated purchase intention, store environment and characteristics of employees as antecedents affecting in-store experiences; while diversion purchasing and customer satisfaction were considered as its consequences. There were designed two studies to test hypotheses. The first study was quantitative approach of an experimental study. Its population included students of Islamic Azad University in Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz. The second study of quantitative approach in the current research is a descriptive-survey study. The variance analysis method was used to analyze the first study data. For this purpose, SPSS software was used in the first study. In the second study, PLS software and structural equation modeling method have been used. The results showed that experience-based purchase incentive affects affective and emotional experiences; and product-based purchase incentive affects cognitive experience. It was found that store lighting has more effects on emotional experience; and layout affects sensory and emotional experiences. It was also found that physical attractiveness and beaming employees influence all three types of in-store experiences, but staff helping affects emotional and cognitive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Historical fabric of Arak, as one of the most important inorganic cities in urbanization history of Iran, has been implemented from the beginning based on predetermined plan and project. During the age that majority of cities in Iran used to be created organically and gradually based on public needs, all steps of construction of Arak City including spatial organization, physical structure, communicative network system, activity distribution pattern and composition of urban elements were firstly designed and then implemented. The main objective of this study is to identify and analyze the physical features of monuments of Arak city to discover the behavioral system of monuments with the composition features standard. According to the research objective, the method applied is descriptive, analytical and comparative method based on field and library investigations. In this study, first architectural composition features including scale, proportion, hierarchy, axis, focus point, composition center, modulus, flexibility, rhythm and geometry are analyzed in each monument. Then, the monuments were classified in sub-factors of each composition feature and then, through comparing the classified groups, common features of monuments in each sub-factor with most frequency are extracted. The results obtained from the study showed existence of unit behavioral system in special groups of monuments compared to architectural composition features leading to typology of Arak&amp;rsquo;s historical monuments.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Today, with the development of urbanization and increased abnormal behaviors, particularly urban crimes, prevention of social harms is of great importance. Social Sciences and Urban Development can prevent crime in urban areas by understanding cultural and social traits alongside other actions, in a way that the wrongdoer finds less opportunity for acting a criminal behavior in urban areas&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; The theory of social capital is intrinsically simple and affecting many other components. The core idea of social capital can be found and summed up in the word &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot;. Members of the community can cooperate and work together through making contacts with each other sustaining this relation. And thus they learn things that cannot be easily achieved alone or is hard-won. Humans are linked through a series of interconnected networks and tend to have values in common with other members of the network. And by expanding networks constitute an asset that can be considered as a form of capital. Obviously, the more people get to know each other and the more common outlook is found within them, we'll have a richer social capital. On this basis, this research will examine social capital in two dimensions, cultural (types of the trust) and structural (social participation and emotional and material support of network). And tries to study the relationship between social capital and social problems in the Pardis new city after explaining the concept of social capital; This research was conducted with survey method using a questionnaire technique. The statistical populations of the study are residents of Pardis new town, who have been selected though a random cluster sampling method. The sample size was determined as 400 people using Cochran Formula and finally data analysis was done with SPSS Software. The results show that increasing social capital components (cooperation, solidarity and social relations), social problems in new towns is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of any contract aims at implementation of the obligations arising from it. Morality dictates that people adhere to what they assumed regarding others. The law also supported the moral judgment and in case of breach of obligations to oblige, compensation as a sanction is imposed on obligor. In view of the economic analysis, he also committed to respect his contract and the Contract shall be performed contrary to the intention of breaching party, and on both sides the effectiveness is motivated to build trust and to maximize contract efficiency. Typically there are two basic solutions in compensation for breach of contract. First, the obligation of obligator to perform obligation, secondly, payment of damages for non-performance, either by the parties in the form of penalty clause or by the court to refer the matter to the expert identified and they are required to pay it. In choosing one of these, economic perspective considers the economic benefits of each of these two solutions. If so economic benefit in cases where subjective commitment and intellectual damage on the implementation of the commitment, as compensation for these losses not compensated correctly, and basically cannot be estimated. In second view, sentence in view of the compensation usually refers to material damages or economic damages, in such cases compensation for losses caused to the obligee can be compensated better and more efficient method is considered. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the purpose of signing the contract because is its implementation and in cases where the performance of contractual obligations under changed circumstances faced hardships, the elimination of obstacles to the implementation of the contract will be resolved, it seems to modify the contract as a mechanism for the implementation of the contract must be considered unless they agreed to be imposed on them by law or judicial authority. In this case, unless the modification is done by mutual consent, it is modification by legal and judicial means economically, we'll see how the parties to the agreement have wanted to do risk allocation or choose the more efficient ones, that is, which party can a lower cost can bear the risk of changing circumstances and consider same party responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The effects happiness has in the work environment for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the employees necessitate the studying and investigating of the concept of happiness in various organizations. Therefore, the current study tries to propose and explain a happiness model in the organization based on national culture. This study has been carried out using a combinatory method and in two sections; namely, the qualitative and the quantitative parts. In the qualitative section, we interviewed experts and university specialists, selected using targeted sampling method, to carry out the identification and classification. In the quantitative section of the study, we utilized the descriptive-survey method and the data gathering tool made by the researcher to elicit the views and opinions of 383 employees of Tehran Municipality, which had been selected using simple random sampling method. Then, we used Pearson&amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient and confirmatory factor analysis to analyze the obtained data. The findings show that physical, psychological, spiritual, and social components are among the personal aspects of happiness based on national culture and components such as coherence and sociability are among the organizational aspects of happiness based on national culture.&lt;/p&gt;

	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a growing trend towards qualitative research in different areas of academic investigations. However, students face difficulties in deciding on qualitative methods of research, because most of the literature on qualitative research focuses on the philosophical and theoretical aspects, and they hardly offer any practical guidelines. This problem is rooted in the essence of qualitative research, which makes the details of the research process unachievable at the beginning. As a result, the features of the sampling plan&amp;mdash;like the accurate size and form of the sampling&amp;mdash;remain uncertain until after the data has been gathered, and this makes the jury doubtful about the approval of the research proposal. Hence, framing an appropriate and assayable plan for sampling can be of great help in the approval and execution of qualitative research plans. From this perspective, the present article aims to design a framework for a sampling plan in qualitative researches using theoretical sources of the grounded theory method and researchers&amp;rsquo; suggestions based on practical involvement, as well as the recent experience of the authors in grounded theory research. By studying these sources, and considering the feedback for and practical involvement in the grounded theory method, a two-stage plan of sampling is proposed. The initial stage aims to ensure adequate diversity for the appropriate distribution of the samples, and the second, as a theoretical sampling stage, guarantees the theoretical attribute of sampling in qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;
