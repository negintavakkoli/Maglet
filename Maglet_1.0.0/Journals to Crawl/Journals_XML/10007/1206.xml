Stress can cause serious problems to the health and academic performance of students. One of the factors affecting stress is the environment. Therefore, finding ways to reduce stress in universities is important and needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, one of the fundamental problems of universities is the lack of features and qualities of a space that reduces the stress of students. This means that university spaces are not designed and constructed for reducing the stress of students and enough attention was not paid to this issue. The relative lack of research in this field makes necessary to pay attention to this issue and carry out studies in this regard. The purpose of this study is to provide effective spatial features to reduce the stress of university students and to determine the effectiveness of each of these features. The&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span new=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;font-family:;&quot; times=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; research is conducted by survey method and Delphi technique was carried out in three rounds. For this purpose, firstly open-ended questionnaires were distributed among the experts. Then the answers were investigated and the lists of features were extracted. In the next step, based on the information obtained, close-ended questionnaires were made and the importance levels of features were put into question among the experts and then data were analyzed using SPSS software. In the final stage, experts expressed their final opinions considering the statistical results of the previous stage. The results of this study showed that effective spatial features on stress reduction of students are classified by influencing level into four categories of environmental conditions, natural factors, environmental comfort and physical aspects. And among the details of these features, adequate and proper light for spaces&amp;rdquo;, connecting with outdoor and semi-outdoor spaces and desirable sound in spaces, are of utmost importance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
