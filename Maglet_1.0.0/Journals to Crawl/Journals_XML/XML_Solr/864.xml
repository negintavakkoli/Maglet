Accordingly, this paper aimed to review the theories and approaches about the phenomenon of street vending and then analyzed the passengers’ attitudes towards women vendors as well as the characteristics and reasons for its spread in subway cars using a survey based on semi-structured interview. The statistical population includes of two groups of traveler women and street vendors of Tehran metro line ۱ and the sample size is ۷۵ and ۸۲ respectively. The results revealed that passengers are more willing to buy from Metro vendors. The major group age of metro’s vendors are young, educated, often immigrants, married and heads of households. The most important reason for this activity is inadequate capital and lack of jobs in the formal sector.
