				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Consumerism as one of the characteristics of the modern world is not limited to commodity consumption. Consumerism has affected communication and even emotional relationship between couples. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between consumerism on couples' relationship and the liquid love. This is a descriptive explanatory study. The method of this study is survey and the statistical population included all married women and men in Tehran. We have selected 384 of them by multi-stage cluster sampling method and responded to a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. The results showed there is a meaningful relationship between consumption and liquid love with 95% confidence level. Stepwise regression analysis also showed that independent variables of consumerism can predict 10.1 percent of variance in the liquid love. These findings suggest that the culture of consumerism and looking at human as a commodity can affect relationships between couples and weaken the sustainability of marital life]]></dcterms:abstract>

Studying women residents with the history of at least one marriage and divorce in Tehran city based on grounded theory method shows a process that focuses on constructing meaning of marriage and family life. This revealed experience and redefinition of living space and the dimension of new identity. Given the women emotional and sexual demands and development of their social capitals, the women are going to change a one-gender public and private living space. Due to unknown peculiarities and dimensions in one hand and ignorance of men to the changes on the other hand and ultimately lack of common language makes the situation ambiguous for men and women and makes family life confusing and discrete. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The departments of Women’s Studies were established in 1970s in the United States. The quantities of the departments and the subjects they cover have increasingly grown during these years by a significant co-relation with the reality of change in women’s status. Women’s Studies are established as the academic wing of the women’s civil movements and it can be understood in terms of changing meanings of the women’s rights and empowerment. Despite its discursive dynamism, Women’s Studies subject is challenged by the paradigmatic shift of gender that has made it insufficient in the content and even in its name. The present study, then, employs the process tracing method based on the records of the Women’s Studies historians to indicate the reflection of women and gender paradigm shifts and their subsequent opportunities and challenges. The process tracing is conducted in three historical phases including binary sex paradigm: women against men (1970-early 1980s), paradigm change from woman to women- women to gender issues (1980s- Mid 1990s), and the dominance of the paradigm of sexual orientation and gender identity (Mid 1990s- Present). To trace this process within the United States is expected to reveal the gender discourse globally.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The experiences of women from mothering are influenced by various living conditions and identities which are socially, economically and politically constructed. This paper reviews the viewpoints of different feminist epistemologies about the issue of “mothering” in terms of theory and practice in order to understand the meanings, assumptions, and implications associated with it, and to find out the historical and theoretical changes of this issue and its impact on political trends and historical transformations. This study based on a historical review of mothering in feminist theory, indicates three paradigms: 1) paradigm of rejection and essentialism including radical and liberal feminism linked to some concepts such patriarchy, oppression and dependence; 2) paradigm of phenomenology including third wave feminism, black feminism, and post-colonial feminism focusing on life experiences and differences; and 3) paradigm of activism, pressure and social change resulted from the theory of maternal thinking and empowered mothering by protesting the discursive patterns of mothering. This introduces restoring authority and legitimacy in mothers and considers the creative and subversive ways of cognition and knowledge in mothering, which can lead to social changes, a widespread development of peace and a more humane world.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Violence against women is a major obstacle to the development of all societies. The violence can be seen in all forms of physical, economic, legal, social and cultural life both in the public and in private spheres. Considering the importance of the subject, this study has been conducted among 20 - 60 year old married women in Tabriz city. The research sample was selected using snowball method. Qualitative data were collected from 24 married women in Tabriz using semi-structured interviews about the main aspects of the research. Data analysis was carried out using the grounded theory and using an open, axial and selective coding approach. The results have indicated that men's physical violence against women reflects a number of tensions and stress. The concept of “stress” in this research indicates the men’s reaction to external and internal pressures in the public and private spheres. In other words, stress is a negative reaction of men to the situation and present situation in the society from which the violence is one of its consequences.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing women’s participation in social, economic, and political activities in rural areas of Likak city. Target population of this study is active rural women of 15 to 64 years old in Likak city. Based on Morgan table, 300 women were selected as sample using a random sampling method. We have used a questionnaire as data collection instrument which its validity was confirmed by a group of experts and its reliability was evaluated by Cronbach alpha coefficients (0.73-0.94). The results of this study have indicated the high mean of women’s participation in social, economic and political activities in the rural society. Moreover, the results have also revealed that there is negative correlation between economic, political and social participations and a number of key variables such as gender stereotype, farmer identity and housewife identity. The results of structural equation modeling analysis have showed that self-efficacy and housewife identity have positive effect on participation intention. In addition, gender stereotype has negative effect on social, economic and political participations. The model explained 85% of the variance in economical participation, 77% of that in social participation, and 69% in political participation. Therefore, it is recommended to give value to the activities of housewives in society and media and to create material and moral rights for these activities. Holding the meeting of housewives with active and successful women can increase women's self-efficacy.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In the twentieth century, with a new wave of political developments in many countries, the researchers sought to understand the preconditions necessary for the emergence and continuation of democracy. Meanwhile, "Modernization Theory" was given the highest empirical support for the realization of democracy. But the ineffectiveness of this theory in practice led to more attention to the role of other factors. One of these factors, which has so far not received much attention, is the role of empowerment of women. In the present study, the "gender-development of democracy" model has been used to study and analyze how women's empowerment has an impact on the democracy development. The econometric method was used as a dynamic panel in the form of Generalized Method of Moment for 1990 to 2015 in selected countries. Findings of the research have indicated that the indicators for assessing the empowerment of women in this research have a significant effect on the development of democracy during the period in question. The two variables of "education" and "female labor force participation rate" have a significant positive effect on the development of democracy with coefficients of +0.61 and +0.07, and the variable "fertility rate" with a coefficient of -0.22 has a significant negative effect on the democracy development.]]></dcterms:abstract>
