				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Skewness of stock return is one of the phenomena observed in the financial markets, indicating psychological bias or tendencies to specific numbers in the market. This study examined the association between systematic risk and skewness in stock's return. To this end, two hypotheses were developed and the data of 98 companies listed on Tehran Stock Exchange, during 2008-2013 and multiple regression with panel data was used to test the hypotheses. The results of the first study suggest that there was a significant correlation between systematic risk of stocks and positive skewness of stock returns. The results of the study also suggest that there was a significant and direct correlation between negative skewness and systematic risk of stock. In other words, the higher the systematic risk, the higher the skewness of stock returns and vice versa. Therefore, the direct relationship between risk and return is confirmed.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Considering a 15-year horizon, this study, using this approach and application Vensim DSS software models and simulates the performance of the financial system of a sand and gravel firm (private joint stock company) which is going to increase its productive capacity. The main purpose of this study is to assess and analyze the investment project for increasing productive capacity and its cost effectiveness. On the other hand, receivable and payable accounts are analyzed and assessed to improve the performance of the financial system. The results suggest that increasing the productive capacity is affordable project. Further, aggressive and moderate scenarios for management of receivable and payable accounts in current situation and conservative and moderate scenarios in increasing productive capacity situation lead to an increase in the financial system variables. Financial experts can use this model as a tool for supporting the company’s development programs and for managing the performance of its financial system.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Financing policies made by managers can play a key role in the risk and wealth creation for stochkholders. However, identifying effective factors in managers` financing decisions is of great importance. Overconfidence is one of the most important personality traits of managers. Overconfidence is effective in risk taking. Overconfident managers overestimate future returns of business projects due to false confidence. Therefore, they might overestimate the likelihood and impact of positive shocks of future cash flows for these projects. Meanwhile, they may underestimate the negative shocks. They believe that their business entities have been undervalued in the capital market and can choose shorter maturity debt and increase shareholder wealth. They prefer to issue bonds rather than stocks. This study aims to examine the effect of a psychological factor (managerial overconfidence) on debt maturity structure. The sample consisted of selected companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2007 to 2014. Two scales which are based on managers` bias to forecast earnings and investment decisions are employed to measure the managerial overconfidence. The results show that managerial overconfidence has a positive and significant effect on debt maturity structure. Overconfident managers take shorter debt maturity structure by applying higher percentage of short-term debt. Liquidity risk related to this financing policy would not prevent them from such behavior.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This research investigates the effect of audit quality on the relationship of collateral value of assets with the firm's financing and investment decisions. Moreover, the firms' audit quality responses to the change in firm's real estate assets were examined. We used changes in a firm’s collateral values caused by changes in real estate prices as an exogenous change to the financing capacity of a firm. The audit firms ranks (carried out by Iranian Association of Certified Public Accountant (IACPA)) were used as a proxy of audit quality. A sample consists of 126 firms listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange for the period 2007 to 2014, 1003 firm-year observations, and multivariate regressions in panel data mode were used to test the hypotheses. The results show that financing and investment by firms with higher audit quality is less affected by changes in real estate values than are financing and investment by firms with lower audit quality. Further, firms select auditors with higher quality in response to decreases in financing capacity. The results also show that changes in collateral value have a significant negative effect on the investment of firms that are more likely to under-investment and audit quality plays decreasing role in this relation.]]></dcterms:abstract>

In this research, a comprehensive review on capital structure theories and its determinants has been made, then the effect of this determinants on the financial leverage of the firms is investigated in three levels: firm specific, industry and economy. In this regard, stepwise regression and pooled mean group model are used. This models specified both short-term and long-term effects of detected factors on capital structure. In this models, as the number of independent variables increase, the co-linearity in the model increases. So, the reliability of model declines and the model can't be a good pattern for financing decisions. In the next step, the identified factors were employed as decision criteria in a hybrid MCDM model that combining DEMATEL and ANP. The ANP weights of the model were used in a Goal programing model and a satisfactory solution for the case study was obtained. By using this model, decision makers can systemically structure a multi-criteria network framework and derive priority weights of those criteria, and then deal with the quantitative financial constraints for a satisfactory solution.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The main objective of this study was to investigate the moderating effect of financial constraints of Kaplan-Zingales Index (1997) on the relationship between the structure of collateral assets and financing structure of the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE).  To this end, the study was carried out using systematic elimination skewed sample consists of 155 firms over the period of 11 years -from 2004 to 2015. The results show that moderating effect of financial constraints on the relationship between and the total collateral assets with financial leverage and components collateral assets (property, plant and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable) with the company's financial leverage is direct and significant. The test of the third hypothesis showed that there is no moderating effect of financial constraints on the relationship between long-term assets and long-term securities held by financial leverage. Furthermore, testing the moderating effect of financial constraints on the relationship between short-term bond funds with short-term financial leverage impose a direct and significant relationship; as well as the moderating effect of short-term financial constraints on components of collateral assets (inventory, accounts receivable) with short-term financial leverage denote that there is a direct and significant relationship and non-relationship for the aforementioned issues, respectively.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Oil futures contracts make it possible for all market participants to remain safe against the crude oil price fluctuations. Islamic Republic of Iran needs to import oil futures contracts to energy exchange for two reasons: First, its national income is highly dependent on crude oil price and instability in oil price leads to unstable economic situation. Second, Oil futures markets provide necessary instruments to reduce risk of oil deals, reduce volatility, increase flexibility and provide broader commercial dimensions to refiners and other buyers of petroleum and related industries. But now, exchange energy, due to jurisprudential constraints, is not able to use this powerful instrument of hedging risk, and this is incompatible with the implementation of economic resistance and resilience policies. This study analyzes financial nature of oil futures contracts and investigates the intend of the parties to the contract and shows that oil futures contracts are not, in any way, type of selling or obligation to selling because the acquisition and consequently delivery of asset are not intended by parties. Therefore, all of those jurisprudential obstacles are wrong about these contracts and are caused by the poor in recognizing the issue.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate transparency and financial constraints in the Tehran Stock Exchange. To this end, 118 companies, listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange, were selected as our sample in the period of 1383-1394 (2004-2015). Applying panel data in multivariate logistic regression models, we tested the hypotheses of the research. In the present study, accounting earning transparency and discretionary accruals criteria represent corporate transparency; furthermore, KZ criterion measures the financial constraints. The Findings of this research reveal that there exists a negative and significant relationship between corporate transparency and financial constraints. This means that companies with more transparent financial information would face fewer restrictions while financing.]]></dcterms:abstract>
