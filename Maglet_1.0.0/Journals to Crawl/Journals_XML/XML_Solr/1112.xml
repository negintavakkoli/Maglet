Cities in national economy are a basis of production. Primer cities and metropolises are economy engines that cover major of goods and services production, and they are most important market for the goods and services produced in these cities, so that if these regions were not existed or the population was distributed sporadically or evenly, such a mass production and market volume were not formed. Given the importance of the metropolitan scale in the economy, based on urban economic theories, it is possible to determine efficient population of cities toward resistive urban economy. In this paper, resisting cities is analyzed by determining efficient population of cities. For calculating efficient population of city, urban social welfare function is specified and estimated. Results show Tehran population exceed efficient population level and bringing the efficient size to the actual size or vice versa by controlling urban population can resist urban economy, and consequently the national economy. Control policy is not enough for resisting urban economy but urban development and urban infrastructure development policies are recommended to increase the capacity of the city.Â </field></doc></add>
