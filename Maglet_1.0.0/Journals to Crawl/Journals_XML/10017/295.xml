				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In the defensive environment, making the right and precise decision is taken as one of the key issues that could change the situation for all groups who are in conflict with each other. Additionally, utilizing appropriate weapons for hitting the enemy’s targets is of crucial significance for operation commanders. This study was run in a bid to design a model for classifying the targets as well as identifying the conflict scenarios in combat management and also made an attempt to assess the significance of targets with regard to the magnitude of the threats and also the existence of dynamic battlefield. On the other hand, this study is aimed to provide an overview of target classification for operation commanders through investigating the capabilities of our own headquarters in defeating and destroying the enemy’s targets as well as investigating the risk of conflict with the potential targets. To address this issue, the conflict scenarios were emerged as the result of two-dimensional plot investigation which provides four axes identifying the conflict scenarios. Thereupon, the scenarios were analyzed through running a mixed method of fuzzy decision making techniques and two-dimensional matrix analysis. In a bid to test this model, the study was also conducted through investigating the operational expert’s consultation and elite interview in which 3 military sites of hypothetical combat situation including 7 targets were emerged as a result of expert consultation. Moreover, the excel software was designed to study these hypothetical situation permanently through using the data obtained from the same distribution of 10 military sites including 20 targets. Finally, according to the data analysis which emerged as a result of elite consultation and also the investigation of hypothetical combat situation , in terms of output model , each of targets were assigned to 3 hypothetical military sites.   ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Human dignity is identified as the backbone of human right and its preservation is also taken as the key of permanent progress and development in every society. Therefore, internalization of organizational culture in light of Islamic values, human dignity and reverence for human and social capital is considered as the main and crucial policy in organization’s administration system and the implementation of such a planning is the primary purpose of many organizations. To delve into this issue in this study, as a qualitative study including meta-synthesis method, this study was an attempt to propose a comprehensive model of personnel human dignity in government agencies. To do so, the components of this phenomenon were identified in the early stages of investigation. Thereupon, the concepts and the components of personnel human dignity were emerged as a result of elite and expert consultation and also the analysis of primary conceptual model. In a bid to apply the exploratory model in terms of meta- synthesis method, the study was conducted through administering a questionnaire among population of 218 personnel affiliated to the department of real estate and registration office in Azerbaijan who was randomly selected based on stratified sampling method. To analyze the data, the confirmatory factor analysis and LISREL software analysis were also run in this study. Thereupon, the components and the parameters of human dignity model were emerged as the result of analysis. Moreover , in an attempt to identify the optimized dimensions of human dignity, 40 questionnaires were also administered among personnel of the Iranian army ground force in Maragheh who were randomly selected based on purposeful sampling method. Moreover, data analysis was run through fuzzy modeling in Matlab software. The findings revealed that in terms of significance of human dignity components, if the personnel pay more attention to the components of human dignity including performance dimension (33%), behavioral dimension (31%), mental and intellectual dimension (30%) and physical dimension (6%), consequently, human dignity of an organization will possess the highest rank in terms of value (62.1).]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Defense expenditure is identified as a major part of total public expenditure in Iran. Therefore, determining the optimal level of defense expenditure plays an important role in the efficient allocation of financial resources in the public sectors which could lead to the national economic growth. For this purpose, this study was an attempt to investigate the non-linear effect of defense expenditure on economic growth and is also aimed to determine the optimal level of defense sector in Iran between the years of 1959 and 2012. To address this issue, the study was conducted through running a logistic smooth transition regression model (LSTR). The findings of this model revealed that defense expenditure are non-linearly affecting the economic growth. Moreover, the place of defense expenditure in gross domestic production was emerged in terms of two main components including infrastructures which effectively affecting the average income per capita with the optimal level of 21%. Additionally, in terms of defense expenditure place in GDP, the first factor has received the positive effect while the second factor has suffered the negative effect. Finally, the hypothesis of an inverse U-shaped effect of defense expenditure on economic growth was confirmed in this study.]]></dcterms:abstract>
