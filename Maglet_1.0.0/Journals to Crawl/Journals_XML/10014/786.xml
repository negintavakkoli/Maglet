	<abstract language="eng">Performance improvement is an area which has been addressed considerably by researchers. However, HR performance Improvement has had less important compared to other resources of organizations. There is no doubt that effective training is the best way to improve and boost human resource performance in workplaces. A manager is competent if he /she demonstrates required competency of his/her job. But, the most important point is that whether having competent project managers can result in desirable performance of their projects or not. The authors in the first step have defined competency, project manager competency, and project performance and maturity. Then, they have evaluated maturity of projects as well as competency of project managers of a state company as a case study (subsidiary of Iran Oil Ministry). Finally, they have determined the most important area of PM competency and also has examined relation between project managers&#8217; competencies and projects&#8217; performance or maturity. The results show that having competent project managers can improve performance of project for which they work and risk management is the most important project management competency.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Providing the oil and gas industry personnel with housing services and opportunities has been one of the most important supporting services offered by the Ministry of petroleum historically. Mortgage lending is one of these housing opportunities. In fact the vast majority of home purchases among the petroleum industry personnel are made with the help of the mortgage loans. Reviewing the administrative background of distributing the mortgage loans among applicants shows that a comprehensive research on the criteria and methodology of selecting candidate personnel has not been accomplished. So, in this study a mixed methodology approach was adopted to identify and rank the important criteria for Distributing Mortgage Loan among Applicants in the Iranian Petroleum Industry. First, the qualitative research interviews were conducted to collect the experts' opinions in order to identify and classify the related criteria. Second, a quantitative methodology was used in order to rank the identified criteria using &#34;Grey Multi Attribute Decision Making&#34; approach.</abstract>

Then, the relationship between variables and facts inferred, by using factor analysis and the application of smart PLS, was tested and approved. And finally the proposed model was presented with the following component dimensions: Leadership Agility (with five components of setting agility background, creating collaboration, creativity, self-leadership, creating synergy); agility in service delivery (with four components of speed, competence and quality, flexibility and innovation, accountability); workforce agility (with four components of intelligence and knowledge, flexibility, cooperation, competence); cultural agility (with five components of cooperation and training, flexibility, competence, innovation and creativity, transparency and trust); Agility of organizational factors (with three components of flexible structure, clear and smooth rules and instructions, modern methods and processes), agility in communication and information technology (with two components of high-speed and updated hardware and infrastructure, software and appropriate and timely programs).</abstract>
