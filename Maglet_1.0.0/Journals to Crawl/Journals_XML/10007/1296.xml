						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=824&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 1em 0px; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: major-bidi;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;Like other economic markets, housing market is comprised of supply and demand dimensions and equality of supply and demand makes the housing market balanced. The aim of this paper is to investigate the characteristics of housing market of Tehran city and some deficiencies of this market with fundamental &amp;ndash; applied methodology. The variable studied here is the saleable residential unit with minimum 50m2 area which is obtained after statistical evaluations of housing price for many years and estimation of the loans and deposit of families in different income levels. Results reveal that problems of housing market can be attributed to lack of appropriate planning in housing building and supply (in quantity, area and geographic location), decreasing purchasing power of people various income levels as a result of misfit of increase in income and price of housing, low demand of families and finally, limited income groups for purchasing appropriate housing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly reflection of architect&amp;rsquo;s character in architecture work, then cultural concept of the work and its belonging to a specific social and ideological movement and besides talent and creativity of the artist, the cultural and artistic movements affect drastically on the result of architect&amp;rsquo;s act who is creator of the art work in form of an architecture event. Therefore it can be mentioned that variables of the present research are nominal and qualitative; the dependent variables are also of the same type. The effects of economic, political, social and cultural movements can also be mentioned which are expressed in form of concepts such as tangible and intangible strategies. The present paper attempted to analyze metaphors used in the major building of Behsharh Industrial Group, which is an objective evidence of Nader Ardalan&amp;rsquo;s work. The analysis was done in a historical-interpretation method and in qualitative form.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Sustainable Disaster Risk Reduction(SDR)  for Developing Countries with emphasis on land system Resilience (LSR); Case Study: Rural and Urban Settlement</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=836&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;With increasing frequency, the developing countries and the people living there are being affected by disasters. More and more often, development efforts are being destroyed. The reason for this trend is their growing vulnerability, which in turn is the result of economic and social development processes, such as the expansion of settlements and agricultural land in risk areas. The economic and social consequences of these disasters for the people in our partner countries last for years. To break and, if possible, reverse this trend, international organizations, governments and NGOs in the developing countries are increasingly upgrading the priority of disaster risk management for policy, and taking concrete preventive measures to reduce the risk to the population. This paper examined the concept of disaster and its management in the light of sustainable development with particular reference to Iran. It enumerated the different human and natural phenomena that could be characterized as disasters. It was discovered that, while hazard and/ or disasters possess anthropogenic origins, their consequences are felt on both human and the physical environments. In all cases, the human tolls have been significant. The paper highlighted the important elements of a typical Disaster Management Information System in Iran. After presenting a typology of disasters in Iran, the paper, advocated for a workable disaster management information system.&lt;/p&gt;

						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=837&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 14.2pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; unicode-bidi: embed; direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;No unique method has been so far specified for determining the number of neurons in hidden layers of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks used for prediction. The present research is intended to optimize the number of neurons using two meta-heuristic procedures namely genetic and hill climbing algorithms. The data used in the present research for prediction are consumption data of water subscribers in Fasa City of Fars Province (Iran) between the years 2010 to 2013. Ultimately, using the respective data set, the data of the subsequent year 2014 can be predicted. In the present research it was observed that the mean square errors of per data (MSEPD) for the abovementioned algorithms are less than 0.2, indicating a high performance in the neural networks&amp;rsquo; prediction. Correlation coefficients using genetic and hill climbing algorithms were respectively equal to 0.891 and 0.759. Thus, GA was able to leave a better effect on optimization of neural network. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Determining the dimensions of organizational forgetting management and prioritizing them in university</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=838&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 1em 0px; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; unicode-bidi: embed; direction: ltr;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: major-bidi;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;This research seeks to determine the dimensions of organizational forgetting management and prioritize them in university. Current research in terms of purpose is applicable. In terms of data, it is quantitative. In terms of method, it is a descriptive-survey research. In this research, for determining the validity of measurement tool, content validity has been used and for calculating the reliability, Cronbach&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;s Alpha method has been used. The population of this research includes the faculty members and employees of Islamic Azad University in region 8. Also the researcher-made questionnaire has been used for information collection. In this research, a framework consisting of quadratic dimensions of the process management, technology, culture and structure for evaluation of organizational forgetting management was considered. With regard to the comparison by using of the mean index, the quadratic dimensions were evaluated in two eligible and available situations. It is determined that with regard to the difference between two available and eligible situations, in fact the level of process dimension is low and it is in available situation, also it can be concluded that culture in available situation is very posterior than ideal and eligible situation. In two technology and structure dimensions, this mean difference is less than two other dimensions. In available situation, the most gaps and deficits at first exist in culture dimension and then in two technology and structure dimensions; and finally there is weakness in the process dimension. Totally in different dimensions, there is a relatively large difference and gap between the mean indexes of two eligible and available situations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=841&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Primary man in trying to find food went everywhere. But by forming ranching arranged a chain of places and became emigrant. By happening industrial revolution, human life was centralized on one place.&amp;nbsp; Places that base on its advantages make different biologic and behavioral types. Forming cities in seaboard, river shore, boundary of mountains and Champaign cause to make different cultures that shows habitat and continent effects on their inhabitants. This definition of human means native man was removing in industrial revolution because modern life advantages aren't depended on habitat. Loom factories develop in every longitude and latitude and cause to form cities that have sit on beds without native values. In fact dependency on a special place in agriculture ages lost its special value and come off in everywhere. In the other hand, in information and media revolution of globalization life Advantages Sea themselves in communication and virtual space that is quite placeless. In fact if we define habitat as an interacting situation between human and a place, we can survey this concept evolution and change procedure from past to now and study its results and effects on human life space quality. In this study we survey efficacy on and getting effect of habitat by studying cultural and anthropologic evolution and genesis of habitat concept and restudy its relation with human real and virtual residential space.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Quality Improving Methods Of Education at  Architecture Conservatories Of  Tehran with Emphasis on Narrative ways of architecture education</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=845&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Architecture education has social, interpersonal and ethical aspects. The role of narration and storytelling as a pedagogical tool in clarification of academic subjects has been argued by researchers.Architecture is a multidisciplinary field of study that draws on the arts, science and social sciences. The aim in educating architects is seen as developing the imaginative, conceptual and practical skills necessary for students to identify human needs and aspirations, and to be able to meet or express these in space and form. Donald Schon asserts that these defining of abilities can be called &amp;lsquo;thinking like an architect&amp;rsquo;. It would be students&amp;rsquo; capacity to see unfamiliar situations as familiar ones, and bring their past experience to bear on the unique case. In the educational process, the main focus not only on the assessment, but also in the process of learning during the lecture&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. The importance of this matter is so that it can be observed in families. Changes in technology, human resources, information technology and changes in consumer preferences, has changed perceptions of manpower required education and skills. Due to increasing importance of vocational training school for girls and the need for quality improvement and evaluation, participation and their role in these changes can be very effective but this partnership in comparison with its true position, is still low and negligible. This study examined documentary and scientific aspects of obstacles and strength points and methods of improving quality of teaching in the Conservatories. So we tried to develop a systematic framework for evaluating Conservatory in Tehran, in order to help resolve this need and with its preliminary implementation, while identifying condition of target Conservatory community, will provide condition of comprehensive evaluation for other technical training institutions so that with knowledge of strengths and weaknesses points and obstacles can improve quality of training centers. The present research, is descriptive and functional that evaluate the state through the questionnaire that has been developed with regard to objectives of the Conservatory training of Tehran, identify the current status, obstacles and also utilizes information obtained from interviews of teachers and experts in this sector in four fields educational, personal, social, economic and four levels of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;high, medium, low and very low&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Due to gathered information and analysis by SPSS obstacles have been reported high extent that finally guidelines and recommendations in order to quality improvement of current situation is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, accountability means being responsible for decisions or actions and being required or expected to justify them. The purpose of this study is to examine and assess the degree and sufficiency of university autonomy in the four area of institutional, financial, staff, and academic and also the degree of accountability of universities to their external stakeholders. The instrument for gathering data was a researcher-made questionnaire with a five- point&amp;nbsp; Likert scale and its calculated Alpha was above ./70. This means that the instrument was reliable. Data were obtained randomly from university managers at Islamic Azad University branches in Qazvin province. The data were analyzed using percentage and five-point Likert scale to objectively determine the degree of accountability and the sufficiency of the university autonomy for good governance of their branches at the four area of autonomy from the view point of university chancellors, vice-chancellors, Dean and Head of the Departments. The analysis of data in relation to research questions were investigated, using one-sample t-test by means of version 18 of SPSS software. The findings indicate that the degree of autonomy in the four area is not sufficient to govern the university well and the University administrators suggest that granting more autonomy from the central administration of Islamic Azad University and Ministry of Science, Technology and Research to the university branches may hold them to be more accountable to internal and external stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Minimalist structures in urban space: a criticism to the works by Sol Lewitt from point of view of Arthur C. Danto with an emphasis on arrangement of works in urban environment </title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=847&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Urban spaces and in other words urban design and architecture have been found with close linkage with art and beauty especially the arts such as &lt;em&gt;painting and sculpture&lt;/em&gt;. Addressing beauty at different areas such as creation of galleries to offer works of art, addressing form of urban spaces and representing works of art in urban environment have improved social life and increased identity, consensus and collective solidarity. On the other hand, it can provide an interesting and calm environment for the citizens and residents. Concurrent with the socio-political developments in the twentieth century and the progress of science and technology, all the areas of the arts were subjected to change. The metamorphosis of the art and stylistic developments took place and a large number of artists tended to innovative phenomena. Since the art at the twentieth century especially the second half of the twentieth century sought to affect the &lt;em&gt;addressee&lt;/em&gt;, a group of the contemporary artists including sculptors have not known the &lt;em&gt;tight enclosure of museums and galleries to represent their works and preferred to display their works at open space and wide and large places of cities. Representing works at open space requires largeness of dimensions of works at multiple scale and use of modern materials and techniques. Sol Lewitt (1928 - 2007) has been regarded among the artists at contemporary age at the area of Minimalism and Conceptual Art. &lt;/em&gt;American philosopher and theorist and contemporary art critic, Arthur Coleman Danto, has conducted articles in criticism to works by &lt;em&gt;Sol Lewitt and has appeared in &lt;/em&gt;exhibition of his works. Lewitt made the earliest structures in 1965 and continued his activity at the 1970s by expansion of plans and planning for the larger projects which have been being made based on &lt;em&gt;morphological&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and conceptual ideas. Ultimately his arrangements were proposed at huge scale and extended from the space of galleries and museums which tended to conceptual and minimalist art to the urban space. In the present research, works of this artist and ideas of Arthur C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Danto about minimalism and works of Sol Lewitt are analyzed. The main questions are as follow: What outcome representation of these works has in natural environment and urban space? how the border between art has removed the daily life and addressee? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>A study on dimensions of Fractal geometry in Iranian architecture</title>

						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 1em 0px; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-bidi-language: FA;&quot;&gt;The subject of geometry and proportions has been regarded as an issue which has a close relationship with architecture. Since the entire universe, living beings and the human geometry can be seen clearly, that&amp;rsquo;s why our unconscious essence has accustomed to these proportions whereby reflection of this mentality can be seen in the architect&amp;rsquo;s hands and thought in the architecture. It can witness a close linkage between nature and architecture at different levels in Iranian architecture which the linkage at architecture geometry has been regarded as one of these levels. Iranian geometry using &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background: white; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;plant and geometric forms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background: white; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;&quot;&gt;in Islamic buildings seeks to prove a special continuity in the life to plant and human world. This continuity in the world of geometry has been known with fractal geometry. The present research seeks to examine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; mso-bidi-language: FA;&quot;&gt;dimensions of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background: white; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;fractal geometry in Iranian architecture and motifs. In following, an attempt is made to examine what the fractal means in Iranian architecture and clarify the motifs and decorations of Iranian architecture after defining the issue of fractal, fractal geometry and fractal in architecture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
