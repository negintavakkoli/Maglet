The research made questionnaire constitutes a measurement tool through which factors in the creation of intellectual capital was identified by the sample. Validity to help them with the help of factor analysis and reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha equal to 78/0. And finally analyzed by factor analysis of main components were analyzed. The findings suggest that the amount of KMO is close to 1 is equal to 881/0. Bartlett test of sphericity is also characterized by a significant level of zero, which is smaller than the 05/0 show statistically significant. And the final outcome of the 9 extracted with PC using varimax rotated in total by performing factor analysis identified nine factors: Self-conscious, value-based and central vision, holistic and systemic approach, independence, spontaneity, sense of mission, altruism, accountability, change frame of mind Factors identified in order to create intellectual capital could have a significant relationship with the studied variables.
