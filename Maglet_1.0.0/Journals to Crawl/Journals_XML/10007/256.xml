	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Urban farms can have the potential to have a great impact on the stability of crowded cities. The purpose of the present study is discovering the effective design-based components in developing urban agriculture in the viewpoint of Tehran&amp;rsquo;s urban managers. It is assumed that the design-based development of urban agriculture improves economic conditions and also food security for Tehran&amp;rsquo;s citizens. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in this research. In the qualitative section of the research, analysis of the influential factors was carried out. Then in order to assess the credibility of the obtained data and obtaining the opinions of the managers, the Delphi method was used. Afterwards, their opinions were gauged and categorized using Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Entropy. The statistical population in this study consisted of 71 city managers and the consultants on designing city spaces who had over 10 years of experience on the job. Quantitative analysis of the data was carried out using the SPSS 22 statistical software. The results showed that establishing and developing design-based urban farming could lead to elevated qualities of environment, food security and economic well-being more than any other factor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
