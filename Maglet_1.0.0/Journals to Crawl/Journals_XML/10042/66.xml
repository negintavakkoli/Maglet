						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=542&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;One of the most important indicators of citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction in metropolises is to provide efficiently banking tools in city.&amp;nbsp; Keeping cash in ATMs is very important for banks. In this paper, increasing citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction from Bank Shahr ATMs has been investigated by using questionnaire among 200 citizens who used them before and after implementing inventory control policy of ATMs&amp;rsquo; cash. This paper investigates the relationship between citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction evaluation and active ATMs by presenting a model of minimizing total costs of missed opportunity for ATMs. In order to simulate consumer behavior of ATMs, Arena software was used. The results indicated that this model can present reorder point, money order, and combination of notes for each ATM. One of the most important findings is identification of effective factors on citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction from ATMs and a model to optimize missed client&amp;rsquo;s costs and surplus money in them. By the help of this model, satisfaction has been increased. The results represented that citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction from services has been reached to 80 percent from 25 percent. Finally, daily total cost of each ATM has been reduced from 1859000 Rials for each ATM to 1147000 Rials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Statistical population includes all residential units in area4, district 4 in the city of Rasht. 90 of them were selected as simple random sampling method and Cochran formula as sample. Statistical data were collected through filling questionnaire in autumn 2013 and analyzed by OLS method and Eviews 8 software. The results indicated that Eynak Lagoon (environmental factors) had negative impact on the price of residential units in the region. As distance from the lagoon increases, housing price rises. However, the variables of land area, type of housing, type of skeleton, and access to medical centers had positive impact on housing price. Contrarily, the variables of distance from Main Street, distance to city center, and access to park had negative impact on housing price in the studied area.
