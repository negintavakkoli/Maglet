Basic topics such as proper location, optimal allocation, diversification, functionality and &amp;hellip which are in direct contact with comfort goals, are the last objectives of urban planners and designers. One of the major issue, which has been paid less attention to, is the incorporation of urban land use. In this paper, which were prepared to assess the incorporation of urban land use and its role in urban sustainability, tried to measure the rate of the incorporation of seven metropolitan areas of Ahvaz by using the Shannon entropy and the latest statistics of related to per capita and percentage of exist land use. The results indicate that the region number one is incorporation than the other regions in terms of land use incorporation, but in general this indicator in the seven regions had little effect on urban sustainability.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
