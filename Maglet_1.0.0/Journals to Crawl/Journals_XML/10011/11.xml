		<Abstract>Nowadays, with technology progress and the emergence of new business models, increased levels of competition and changing demands and expectations of customers, using multi channels of distribution is growing rapidly. The coordination and integration of these channels with high efficiency and the elimination of these challenges requires more discussion. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of communication in coordinating multiple distribution channels from the perspective of the supplier. This study aimed to identify influential capabilities in coordinating multiple distribution channels from the supplier’s perspectives. Statistical population of this study included electronics products suppliers in Tehran. Statistical sample of this study is 157 marketing and sales managers. Data analysis using structural equation modeling technique was conducted. Findings suggest that capabilities such as communication strategy, information quality, information technology and information sharing are affecting factors in coordination of multichannels and have positive effect on supplier financial and non-financial performance.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>According to rapid changes in information age, Iranian organizations should move faster toward optimization of e-business. In order to achieve this strategic goal, recent study develops a conceptual model for presenting the factors affecting e-business diffusion (internal integration and external diffusion) based on TOE framework. The purpose of this model is examining the influence of technological factors (IS infrastructure and IS expertise), organizational factors (organizational compatibility, expected benefits of e-business, top management support and organizational learning ability) and environmental factors (competitive pressure and trading partner readiness and regulatory environment) on e-business diffusion. This model was tested by 90 managers who are familiar or involved in information system projects in different Iranian organizations with a questionnaire. The research method applied in this study is descriptive by using structural equation modeling. The findings show that organizational factors on internal integration and environmental factors and internal integration have positive meaningful effects on external diffusion. The findings also show that technological factors have no positive meaningful effect on e-business diffusion.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>According to several reports, in spite of huge investment on customer relationship management (CRM), risk of implementing such projects is high. One of failure factors is having no method to assess CRM success comprehensively. Nowadays, classic financial methods are common ways for assessing marketing and CRM initiatives. But, the mentioned models are unsuitable to assess investments like CRM that we expect to have intangible, indirect and strategic benefits. So, we need a process-oriented approach to assess all tangible and intangible factors of CRM process and complete existing models. In this paper, using a qualitative approach and grounded theory, a comprehensive and process-oriented CRM assessment model will be provided that considers all factors of customer relationship management in private-commercial banks of Iran. Finally, based on analysis of developed model, some suggestions will be offered for banking managers and future researchers.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>: Automobile industry is one of the industries in which strive for supply chain collaboration have always been significant. With regard to importance of information sharing issue as a key mechanism in the supply chain collaboration for top managers of Iranian automobile companies, the purpose of this research has been the designing and modeling the factors affecting information sharing in supply chain of Iran Khodro Khorasan (IKK) Company. Statistical community of this research includes IKKCo supply chain experts. Accordingly, at first by studying the literature and background of the subject, 20 subsidiary factors of this structure were defined and after doing some interviews with experts, these factors increased to 22. Then the proposed conceptual model was tested through semi-structured interviews. With regard to methodology, &quot;sequential integrated research&quot; is performed, and the primary model was introduced by using cognitive mapping methodology. The output of this stage is the introduction of the primary model. To ensure the designed model, the modeling of Bayesian networks was used to confirm the model. The final output of this research can be the conceptual model of the information sharing in supply chain collaboration of IKK company.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Nowadays BPR has become as one of the most widespread and safe management topics and a redeemer for organizations which are in the stage of destruction and ruining. Although many organizations use BPR to improve their performance, researches show that about 70-80 percent of these projects were failed and remain unfinished. Many researches have been even undertaken to find out reasons of these failures. Lack of an adequate methodological approach and perception and using non-adequate tools and techniques in its implementation, are some of the main reasons for these failures. Using computer simulation in modeling and analyzing the process is one of the best and most adequate BPR techniques which can decrease these failures and increase their implementation success. In this paper, following an application and also case study research methodology, 51 BPR and 24 Simulation methodologies, approaches and techniques were considered and on the basis of Kettinger et al.&#039;s research method done in the BPR area to develop a compound methodology for BPR, a comprehensive combined methodology using simulation technique was presented. Finally the results of a project done using this methodology in a process of NIORDC (National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company) were presented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>In the knowledge-based era knowledge management (KM) is considered as the primary task of organizations that strive to utilize of their intellectual capitals effectively. Hence it is vital to understand carefully the appropriate contexts and enablers of knowledge management practices. Human- social factors are among most influential factors that their effects are as important as structural and technological enablers. In spite of these vital effects, their role has not been studied sufficiently. This article tries to explore the simultaneous effects of the human capital, social capital and cultural capital on the effectiveness of knowledge management practices. It will investigate the way in which these intellectual capitals can enforce attitudes and behaviors required for implementing KM effectively. The population of the research consists of 950 person of managers and senior experts of the NIOPDC. A sample of 270 subjects was selected as statistical sampling. According to the research findings, these human-social factors have a considerable effect on the effectiveness of KM. These findings support the necessity of adopting a more humanistic approach for implementing knowledge management more effectively.</Abstract>
