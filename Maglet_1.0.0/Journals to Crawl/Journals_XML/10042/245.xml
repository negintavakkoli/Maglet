	<Abstract>With the complexity advent of cities and increase of their problems, municipalities manage the problems of cities by employing strategies such as City Development Strategy (CDS). This research has a descriptive &#8211; analytic essence, which it sets to the application of Goal Programming model for optimal allocation of construction budget of Isfahan Municipality. It has been tried to identify the most important construction budget&#8217;s constraints, Non-priority sectors in the allocation of construction budget, model goals and the impact of subsections of construction budget in achieving the objectives of CDS and checking out the achievement of CDS objectives with current budget management method. The target society includes all the staffs of Isfahan Municipality and 11 of them have been selected for the sample size in non&#8211;random manner. In order to analyze the values in years 2011 to 2014, Goal Programming model was used. Some of the required data were collected by using the questionnaire and some of them were extracted from the Municipality documents. According to the model stipulated in three forms, the results of the most complete model indicated that because of the lack of appropriate models for planning the credits and relying on the bargaining power, the allocation of the construction budget was not optimal in any years and the given values to variables do not achieve the goals mentioned in the CDS, and the credits in some subsections were considered more or less than enough, and goal programming model will be a useful tool in determining the optimal values in future years.</Abstract>

One of the factors of the formation of inequalities in Tehran districts is the physical growth and development of Tehran Metropolis and lack of proportional and coordinate distribution of facilities and urban services with it. The purpose of this research is evaluation and analysis of prosperity levels of Tehran Metropolis districts in terms of having economic, social, physical, cultural, servicing and recreational. For the spatial analysis of justice status in Tehran Metropolis, at first research indicators were loaded into four factors: economic, social, physical and servicing-recreational, with &#8220;R&#8221; factor analysis model and then, each of the indicators of 22 districts of Tehran Metropolis were graded by using the hybrid model of human development&#160;and cluster analysis according to rating factor. The results show that among 22 districts of Tehran Metropolis, district 6 has the highest development degree at a rate of 0/95, and districts 3, 1, 2 and 7 are half-prosperous ones. Generally, in terms of prosperity of consolidated indicators, 4.55 of Tehran Metropolis districts are prosperous, 18.18 of them are half-prosperous and 77.27 of them are non-prosperous .</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Organizations invest high amounts annually in order to improve the staff&#8217;s performance in the field of training and learning. Despite the great deal of attention to training and its programs, accomplished studies suggest that many of these programs do not have required effectiveness in terms of learning transfer and transmission of learned skills to the workplace, as an important effective indicators of training programs, have done very little and the rate of the obtained capital return on investment is very low for them. So, awareness of predisposing or obstacle factors of learning transfer to the workplace and consequently investment return in human resources for organizations are of great importance specially for banks and municipalities. Therefore, models and current studies regarding the learning transfer were investigated in this research and an effective model of learning transfer was presented parallel with return on investment in human resources development&#160;emphasising on urban management. The results showed that major factors of learning transfer from training environment to the workplace include individual and organizational factors. Individual ones are those influencing on the knowledge use and acquired skill from training environment in workplace and include motivation, attitude, self-efficacy and personality characteristics. Organizational factors are those related to the workplace and they influence on learning transfer and its use of whatsoever learned during training courses and they include support, responsiveness, job career, organizational climate and individual results.</Abstract>

Currently, one of the main approaches in urban and rural management fields in the country is reducing dependencies on governmental aids and dues and moving toward identifying T stable earnings and new instruments of providing financial resources such as: attracting domestic and foreign investors.

The main goal of this research is studying the effective factors on the participation of private sector providing stable financial recourses for municipality projects. According to the collected data, part of the potential investors do not participate in urban projects, therefore, using usual econometric methods have incompatible results. In order to estimate the parameters of this function, Logit and Probit method based on the maximum likelihood function is used. It is necessary to mention that for estimating function, Stata software is used. The statistical population is Tabriz city and its municipality. Required data were collected via survey method and the instruments of data collection were questionnaire and field findings. In this study, random sampling method was used and for determining the required sample size Cochran formula and Morgan table were used. The findings of this research show that factors such as improving business environment and efficient laws which guarantee the profit of private functionary make private sector increase the implementation of urban projects, and the presence of bureaucracy and lack of suitable capacity building delay the process mutually.</Abstract>
