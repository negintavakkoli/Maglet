				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The origins of sports traditionally dates back to its practice encouraged by religion, custom or militancy, and, therefore, was considered a wholly masculine practice. Due to the inextricable link between sports and body management, nowadays, leisure and health have transcended their meaning beyond a certain gender and, consequently, sports has become a wholly ordinary practice for women. To attain an insight into the women’s experience and understanding of sports, this research conducted a semi-structural interview with 30 samples of women with sports experience, using a Grounded Theory method. The results show that the practice of sports by women is chiefly due to their concern about the maintenance of symmetry in the spatial-locative context and body fitness.Incidentally, striving for equality, maintaining an idealistic view of the body as a facilitating element, and the widespread broadcast of sports and its popularization have also been contributing factors.The meaningful implications of women’s appreciation of sports include their consciousness towards sports (sports as a functional identity), deconstruction of the social strata, body symmetry and pleasure. The research concludes that sports has offered women social acceptance, the opportunity to rethink and transcend physical and psychological well-being.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This research is aimed at measuring the happiness of the women who conduct a family in Tehran and identifying the causes and background of such happiness and also the causes of ostracism and the ways it affects their happiness. This is an explorative survey. For this purpose,  30 women were selected through snowball sampling and the data was collected through interview and then a survey was conducted with the population of 180. The interviews demonstrated that: factors such as deprivation from basic needs and SENSE OF DISCRIMINATION have excluded these women from the society and that is why they feel being discriminated and less happy. . Based on regression equation, about 70 percent of the changes in terms of happiness of the female heads in Tehran is because of  lack of fairness, social ostracism and SENSE OF DISCRIMINATION and also lack of effective provision of basic needs which faint away their happiness. Based on path analysis equation, social ostracism is the strongest factor, which negatively affects their happiness directly and indirectly. Lack of fairness comes next in terms of direct effects. Sense of discrimination and effective provision of the basic needs are  other factors that affect their happiness respectively.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Based on statistical evidence, rate of cesarean   in Iran is quite high ranking Iran  the second country in the world; in terms of the highest cesarean rates,  various parameters affect  decision of  delivery mode  in pregnant women. One way to reduce caesarean sections is to identify these factors and their impacts. The aim of this study is to identify factors affecting willingness to cesarean section in pregnant women and the correlation between them to reduce the willingness to C-section. This study was examined in a cross-sectional way by means of stochastic and available selection procedure, within the second half of 2014, on pregnant women who live in Tehran. In the semi-structured survey with the answer package (5 point Likert scale), five effective factors to predict   willingness to cesarean were examined  including psychological, environmental and socio-cultural factors, as well as conditions and outcomes of childbirth;  structural equation modeling (SEM) method and Amossoftware were utilized in order to confirm the parameters. Among the 5 factors affecting willingness to cesarean section in pregnant women, "fear of natural childbirth"  related to psychological factors and the component "Not to put pressure on the baby's head" and "no shoulder dislocation  other physical damages” caused by Caesarean section related to the consequences of childbirth, have the greatest impact. Also the results of this study demonstrated that the highest and lowest correlations are related to conditions and consequences and socio-cultural and psychological factors respectively. Therefore, we can help pregnant women to recognize their capabilities and overcome their fear of pain by improving the level of pregnant women’s awareness and using natural vaginal delivery techniques with lower pain.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Gender as one of the social and cultural determinant factors, affects many dimensions of women including their occupation and can affect  the types of male and female jobs. Nowadays, gender segregation of jobs in Iran is gradually being removed. Nevertheless, social policy making in this subject needs scientific studies. It seems necessary to take advantage of qualitative methods. In this qualitative study using focus group discussions, views of  19 women and family experts  about the phenomenon of women presence in occupations and its reasons were questioned and discussed. The findings and thematic analysis showed three types of views including: supporters,  opponents and intermediate. Individual and communicative capability elevation, economic and social justice realization are mensioned as positive implications of women entering  male jobs. In some experts’ views, seperation of women jobs prevents their talent development, strengthens gender beliefs in society and economic-gender imbalance. But opponents of women entering  male jobs see this entrance as equivalent to women distancing from women world, identity and personality imbalance, physical and mental exhaustion, reduction of marriage opportunity, sexual and ethical insecurity and male social reactions.   ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Humans, since their creation, have experienced different political systems. In addition, it seems that the training in families is the key to open the future; therefore, it is expected that the family system of each human society nurtures and trains future humans and prepares the present generation for the future. The task of families is to empower all members of a society to develop their hidden potentials and provide grounds for realizing them in humans and also to empower the society in identifying its creativities and potentials. Accordingly, deep political advancement and development in societies for attaining determined aims far from radicalism, particularly in the domains of societies and politics, will not be possible without paying attention to the family structure and training methods dominant over this structure. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of different upbringing methods in families from democratic perspectives among male and female citizens of the City of Isfahan in 2015. By dividing upbringing methods into three types of authoritative, tyrannical, and easygoing , the results indicate that authoritative methods with the coefficient of 49.0 causes the increase in the democratic perspectives, but tyrannical methods with an coefficient of -18.0 causes a decrease in democratic perspectives among citizens. In addition, other findings indicate that although the results of the research among men are consistent with the general results of the research, tyrannical methods have no significant correlation with democratic perspectives among the studied women.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Any economic development planning of rural regions needs an initial investigation of rural women's role in the production system, hence the purpose of this descriptive- survey study was to investigate rural women's role in animal husbandry activities. The statistical population consisted of all rural families (N=6571) in Charuymaq county among which 135 were selected through a multistage randomised sampling method based on Cochran's sampling formula. The research tool was a researcher-constructed questionnaire the  validity of which was verified by a panel of experts in the related field and to check its reliability, a Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was computed which was higher than 0.7 for composite constructs. The results showed that majority of women (60.7%) had a neutral attitude toward animal husbandry activities. Hard nature of animal activities was the most important barrier of women's participation.  Preparing households food requirements (self-consumption) and feeling responsibile toward household were the most intrinsic and extrinsic motives of women regarding their participation, respectively. The majority of women had a low level of mass media information usage and TV was the first source of their information  gathering. Women had the highest participation in milking and processing and the least in grazing the animals.]]></dcterms:abstract>
