In this paper we seek to indentify and classify the factors influencing organizational citizenry behavior in Tehran petroleum industry research center using multi- indicator decision making models (TOPSIS - SAW). In order to gather data and determine the priorities between indicators, a questionnaire was used.

			<abstract>
			Oil and gas well drilling operations due to the nature and type of activities is dealing with various hazards. So protecting human resources and equipment is mandatory for all staff. This study aimed to identify the risks of drilling jobs using the &#8220;Job Hazard Analysis&#8221; (JHA) study and provide control measures to reduce the risk of these hazards. Statistical population of interest in this project is land rig drilling operations staff in North Drilling Company (NDCo). In order to collect the required data formed a team of experts in industrial safety, occupational health and drilling operation. Then the tasks and subtasks were identified in the drilling operation unit and by completing Job Hazard Analysis Technique worksheets, each of these activities was identified hazards. Finally, to rank the risks identified &#8220;William Fine&#8221; method was used. The results showed that 71.7 percent of risk safety hazards are identified and then health hazards, ergonomic hazards and hazards associated with materials and equipment, respectively, 13.4, 9.3 and 5.6 percent were the risks identified. Also 84.4 and 36.5 % of low-risk and moderate-risk levels were identified, respectively and 15.1 per cent of the risk levels were high risk that they require immediate implementation of control measures to reduce the risk level of hazards
