Organizational commitment has been one of the most popular work attitudes studied by practitioners and researchers. This article seeks to investigate the mediating role of psychological contract (PC) in the relationship between person-job (PJ) fit, person-organization (PO) fit and organizational commitment (OC). The target population for this study consists of support staff of Iran&#8217;s national gas company. The instrument for gathering data was questionnaire. The results of research showed that psychological contract fulfillment (PCF) has a positive and significant effect on OC. The results also showed a significant, positive and relatively weak effect of PO on PCF and OC. Despite of this, PCF could not mediate the relationship between PO and OC. This article adds new findings to the PC literature and emphasizes the importance of interactive role of PO, PJ in affecting on OC.

It is obvious that in our country, a large part of capital and budget of projects is spent for training and experience of managers who is responsible for managing and guiding the projects, while the experience may be archived in chest or shelves of managers and other executives. In most of projects, there are using trial and error methods in using of experiences and knowledge, as a result large sums of national wealth will be wasting. Application weakness of knowledge management and project implementation is one of the main problems raised by the implementation of all the projects. Knowledge and experiences of projects remain more in minds of those involved in implementing the project in other words , the main challenge of Projects is lack of attention to the concept of organizational memory as a maintenance and development status of the most valuable assets available and usable in next organization projects.

While Traditional knowledge management emphasis is more on the technology and designing information systems, modern approaches focus more on human resources and their behaviors in knowledge sharing. So this research aims to investigate the influence of social capital on knowledge sharing between human resources of Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) by focusing on human features of knowledge sharing. Data was gathered using questionnaire. Results show that social capital affects on inter and intra departments knowledge sharing; high educated employees have more social capital, however people with higher managerial experiences, show less social capital than less experienced employees. It seems that managers don&#8217;t prefer to share their knowledge and experiences with their subordinates especially the more competent or new employed ones. Finally it is suggested that corporations working in petroleum industry, as the corporations which are successful in knowledge management, should share their experiences and knowledge with other corporations.&#160; It is assumed that it might lead to Iran development in long run.&#160;

This study aimed to design a strategic model of talent management at Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) based on international best practice experience. Research method is a mixed method (qualitative-quantitative) and sampling is done in two phases.&#160;In qualitative phase, sample included 24 top managers and senior executives (experts) who were selected by purposive sampling and in quantitative phase, by random sampling method and using Cochran formula, sample size of 267 people were selected among all employees. Based on the related literature and accessible documents on this subject in POGC, the primary dimensions and components of strategic talent management were determined.&#160;Then, in order to fit the dimensions and components with the characteristics and expectations of company, the opinions of experts participating in interviews were analyzed by using content analysis method. In this way, the initial model of strategic talent management in POGC was designed. After evaluating and modifying the initial model by a second-order factor analysis, the final model was designed.&#160;In comparison with current domestic and international models, some distinct features of this model are its systematic basis, comprehensiveness and also its strategic approach that leads to consider the external environment and its adaptation with the internal environment and more importantly, the use of this strategic model of talent management helps POGC officials to have a&#160;unified framework for the identisication, development, maintenance and keeping ahead of valuable human capital rather than repeating what is done in human resource management department, and thereby meet the emerging challenges and needs of the company.
