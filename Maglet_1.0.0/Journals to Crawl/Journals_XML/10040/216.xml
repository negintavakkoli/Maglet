				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study examines educational inequalities between boys and girls in secondary schools by using context, space, human resources, education coverage, education process, outputs and outcomes as comparative indicators. The research study is a descriptive - analytical survey. The required data have been collected through both using documents and questionnaires. Using stratified random sampling, the questionnaires were distributed among a sample of 815 high school students (419 boys and 396 girls) in province of Western Azerbaijan. Validity of questionnaires has been confirmed by using factor analysis and reliability by using Cronbach’s Alfa. The findings suggest that in the context of inequality, except for educational sensitivity of parents no other variable showed a significant difference between boys and girls. Given the disparity in the space, human resources and educational coverage indicators,, a significant inequality is evident between boys and girls. As to the question of inequality in educational processes, apart from inequality in the justice treatment, there is no significant difference between boys and girls. For the question of inequality in outputs and outcomes, the educational success of female students as well as their higher percentage of passing the university entrance and developed motivation toward school, shows higher status of girls.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In recent decades, changes can be observed around the presence of women in urban public spaces. This paper investigates on the presence of women in these spaces in terms of selectivity or necessity. Method of research is survey and questionnaire is used to collect data. The statistical sample includes 128 male and 133 female residents of the city of Tabriz that are studied with random sampling. According to the research findings, freedom and independence of women for attending in public spaces is less than those of men. Family restrictions, female specific tasks and lack of performing suitable activities for women in public spaces such as park are the most important limiting factors for the presence of women in public spaces. The presence of women in this sphere has been intensively increased. With regard to the extensive presence of women in academic, educational and working centers, part of this increase is inevitable. Another reason is related to the reduction of men and households' resistance against women for their presence in public spheres. In other words, social attitudes (including both groups of women and men) have been transformed toward urban public spaces and participation of women in these spaces.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The rate of suicide globally and in Iran is increasing. Suicide destroys human capital and poses huge obstacles for the improvement of women’s health and for the wider public health agenda. The main objectives of this paper is to review the available evidence on suicide in Iran as well as to explore the underlying causes and reasons for suicidal tendencies among Iranian women. The paper tests whether economic inequality, unemployment, urbanization and the rate of divorce is related to suicide mortality. Using an unbalanced panel of 30 cities for the period 2006-2009 allows us to control for the effect of unobserved factors that may have an impact on suicide rates. The results show that unemployment, inequality, urbanization and divorce rate is significantly associated with female suicide rates. Our results indicate that there is a statistically insignificant positive effect of unemployment, inequality, urbanization and divorce rate on the incidence of suicide. Finally, suicide rates were not sensitive to income levels, divorce rates. The paper suggest the need for further and deeper investigation on other effective indicators.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[There are new evidences to suggest that personality and emotional intelligence play a significant role in origin of entrepreneurship. However, few studies are carried out in this area particularly with regard to gender differences among individuals. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of emotional intelligence on students’ entrepreneurship competencies in agricultural fields of Zanjan University and to examine the moderating effect of gender on the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship competencies. The target population of the study contained all M.Sc. students in agriculture faculty of Zanjan University (n=366). According to Krejcie and Morgan table, a sample size of 280 was selected using a stratified random sampling method (n=280). A questionnaire was used to collect the data. A panel of faculty members in University of Zanjan confirmed the content validity of the questionnaire. A pilot study was conducted to establish the reliability of the instrument. Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient for the main scales of questionnaire was at appropriate level. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) multivariate technique. The results showed that emotional intelligence had a positive and significant effect on dependent variable of entrepreneurship competencies explaining about 35 percent of its variances. Also, the result indicated that gender had a moderating effect on the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship competencies; so that the relationship was non-significant for male students, whereas it was positive and significant for female students.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The theoretical framework of research is Role Conflict theory. Survey methods is used in this study and the statistical population included all women working in the city of Aran &amp; Bidgol. Using Cochran's formula and Simple Random Sampling, 250 married women were selected as research sample. Statistical tests show that there is meaningful and direct relationship between Conflictin Social Relations, Conflict in Housekeeping, Conflict in Spouse Handling, Conflict in Children Handling, Age, Number of Children and Work Pressures. There is also an inverse relation between Education and Working Pressure. In the Multivariate Analysis and Path Analysis among the four first variables, only two variables, namely Conflictin Social Relations and Conflict in Housekeeping, entered into the regression equation and other variables are out of the equation. As a result, Work Pressure on employed women creates effects on their Social Relations and Housekeeping that in trurn, creates new conflicts for them. The paper argues how Role Conflicts, in particular Work Pressures, can create risks for physical and mental health of working women.]]></dcterms:abstract>
