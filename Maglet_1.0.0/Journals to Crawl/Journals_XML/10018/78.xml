				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The ability to identify and utilize external knowledge and technologies, called "absorptive capacity", is one of the main competitive factors at firm and national level. Different factors affect absorptive capacity, and a purpose of this paper is to identify these factors discussed as common innovation infrastructures. The other purpose is to examine the impact of absorptive capacity on the innovative performance of countries. The proposed conceptual model is composed of three dimensions of "common innovation infrastructure", "national absorptive capacity" and "Innovative performance", and includes 8 constructs in total. This study is of applied and correlational type with 81 countries around the world selected as its sample based on the availability of their data. The data is gathered from different databases, and structural equation modeling is used to analyze and validate them by AMOS software. The results show that the experimental data fit the conceptual model, and that absorptive capacity is a confounding variable in positive effect of common innovation infrastructures on national innovative performance.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The incomplete implementation of policies is a problem all developed and developing countries must deal with. From the perspective of policy-making knowledge, the main reasons for the issue are factors hindering the implementation of the policies at different levels. This study aims to identify the barriers of science and technology policy implementation in Iran, with an emphasis on Iran's National Comprehensive Scientific Map as a major plan and 3 other sub-plans, namely National Aerospace Development Document, Stem Cell Science and Technology Document, and Medicinal Plants Document. To this end, a synthetic method including a quantitative and a qualitative phase is used. In the qualitative phase, by reviewing the literature, the barriers to policy implementation are classified in a framework. Then a list of barriers is provided, revised and completed with the help of some policymakers and aforementioned roadmaps and plans executives through interviews. In the quantitative phase, for weighting the identified barriers, a questionnaire is designed and distributed among 31 experts and policymaking executives through selective and subjective sampling. According to the survey, the main barriers to the implementation of the science and technology policy documents are: the problem of priorities, because each action listed in the document must have its own priority; ignoring foresight results in drafting documents; policies inadaptability with existing challenges; the absence of networking among policymakers; non-governance of major policies; the lack of multi-sectoral vision; the insular structure of bureaucracy; and lack of long-term vision to management and governance of policy programs.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Employees' knowledge-sharing is a key to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in current dynamic economy, especially in high-tech firms. Effective knowledge-sharing among employees can considerably affect the time, cost and quality of research and development activities in such organizations. Therefore, this paper is aimed at examining how to form knowledge-sharing behavior in a high-tech firm based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). To do so, after reviewing the literature on knowledge-sharing determining factors, TPB is explained. Then, the conceptual model and research hypotheses are discussed. A descriptive-survey method is used and a questionnaire developed for gathering data. Also, partial least squares (PLS) method is used to test the research hypotheses. The results of analyzing data gathered from the statistical population show that attitude toward knowledge-sharing, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have significant positive effects on knowledge-sharing intention. Additionally, the research findings indicate that knowledge-sharing intention and perceived behavioral control significantly influence knowledge-sharing behavior. Finally, some practical implications are offered for knowledge management practitioners to foster employees' knowledge-sharing, and some suggestions for future works to overcome current research shortcomings.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Considering the increasing competition and continuous changes in international business environment, it is vital to take advantage of strategic initiatives in order to develop new products with appropriate performance. Export is an important strategy for expanding limited internal markets to vast international markets. There are different factors affecting the export performance of new products. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of entrepreneurial orientation and innovation ambidexterity on the export performance of new products with regard to the moderating role of innovation intensity of product. For this purpose, the opinions of 81 executives and experts of an automobile manufacturer and exporter company are gathered through a questionnaire. The data is analyzed by structural equation modeling and SmartPLS 2. The results show that entrepreneurial orientation has a significant impact on innovation ambidexterity and the export performance of new products. Also, the impact of innovation ambidexterity on the export performance of new products is confirmed. The innovation intensity of product moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and the export performance of new products, and the relationship between innovation ambidexterity and the export performance of new products.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study along with investigating the reasons for innovation success, looks into the requirements for the formation of sectorial innovation systems based on Malerba innovation model. After reviewing innovation literature and extracting key success factors of innovation, we identify key success factors of UAV industry through interviews with the industry experts. Then we determine the importance and priorities of factors by statistical analysis of the data gathered by the questionnaires distributed among the elites and experts of the industry. The findings show that UAV industry key success factors in order of importance are: cooperation and communication network among manufacturers, suppliers, clients and users; a clear and precise definition of innovation projects by clients; and precise allocation of financial resources to project based on project value by government.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Following the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution, a large number of foreign experts were sacked from the defense industries, and by the beginning of the war imposed on Iran and enforcing tough sanctions against the country, weak innovation process in defense industries was halted. Afterwards, extensive efforts were started in innovation process and patterns in defense industries. The main features of these efforts were self-reliance, taking advantages of limited technological collaboration opportunities, and activities based on try and error. Since no studies have been conducted on the typology of evolutionary processes in this period, this aims to identify innovation patterns. To this end, 15 major defense projects compatible with the determined defense success measures are investigated through deep exploratory interviews with defense elites and executive experts, and through conceptual analyses to extract concepts, components and innovation process models. The validity of the study is tested by three-front validity method. Finally, 4 different paths of defense innovation are extracted based on the classifications of key defense products. The results show that all these paths begin with operational need and all had the phases of team creation and research institution. All these paths lead to the formation of an industrial and manufacturing institution, and the improvement of functional specification and innovation development.]]></dcterms:abstract>
