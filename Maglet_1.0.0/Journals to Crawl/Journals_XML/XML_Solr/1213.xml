Based on the production of culture as a new regeneration approach, regeneration supports creative industries and uses cluster development of these industries as a centerpiece of regeneration. With descriptive-analytical method, this research tries to evaluate the position of Shiraz historical-cultural fabric in relation with creative city indicators, to investigate cluster development of cultural industries in this area, and realize possibilities of regeneration based on cultural production in the studied area. The findings indicate that Shiraz historical-cultural fabric (municipality-district8) with coefficient of 0.58 is ranked in partially prosperous in terms of creative city indicators in the city of Shiraz. Yet, studies related to cluster development of cultural industries and businesses indicate despite geographical and cluster concentration of domestic and handicraft industries, and publishing industry, lack of cooperation network and effective links between related entities with each category have helped not to fulfill cluster development of creative industries. Other known cultural categories including museums and cultural institutes do not have cluster geographical distribution and they enjoy low level of density link in their institutional network.</field></doc></add>
