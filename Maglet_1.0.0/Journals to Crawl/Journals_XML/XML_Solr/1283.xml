The present study aimed at designing a model of sustainable urban management in the field of lighting, with simulation of the use of photovoltaic LEDs instead of sodium and halogen lamps. Accordingly, in a system simulation of the network, the scenarios for adjusting the input of various photovoltaic capacities to the electricity supply system of the city of Mashhad have been investigated. The results of on-grid analysis by using this decentralized production pattern shows, taking into account the 200 watts capacity and the 20% utilization factor for each photovoltaic LEDs and installing a photovoltaic LED instead of sodium and halogen lamps, all the power needed to lighting of city streets is provided by photovoltaic solar technology. Moreover, by reducing the potential between fossil and renewable production, emissions of pollutants are reduced by 104,000 tons. Therefore, this method can be used to manage clean and sustainable energy in urban scale consumption, and, while helping the environment and reducing air pollution, it prevents losses caused by the transfer of electrical energy from the plant to the place of consumption.</field></doc></add>
