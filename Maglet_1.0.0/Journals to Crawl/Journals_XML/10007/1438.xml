	<Abstract>Human beings' works and products are somehow indicative of his beliefs, opinions and ideals. Cities and urban elements as one of the products of human beings will not be independent of the relationship too and they are influenced by beliefs, opinions and demands of citizens. And the current article concentrates on the influence of Islamic opinions and teachings on products of human beings. On the other hand we can note that in different eras the role and the importance of designing urban elements for organizing the space, beautification and promoting mental image of citizens have been considered differently by designers. But most of these elements and ideas have been in conflict with Islamic identity and teachings and they emphasized on negligence and sheer attention to material issues in urban spaces. Thus attention to principles and basics of designing Islamic city in general and attention to and application of reminiscence (as one of the qualities of Islamic urbanization) in specific seems necessary for designing elements of urban beautification. Reminiscence which derived from Islamic teachings is one of the principles and criterions with great importance in developing the urban elements. The space of reminiscence is against the space of negligence. The space of reminiscence is the basis for awakening and dealing with main subjects of human beings' life. Such a space emphasize on keeping the thought of god alive and abstinence from negligence. But it should be noted that in analytical survey of this article besides the spiritual concepts, worthy worldly concepts have been considered too. Among other items which have the reminding role in urban spaces include: natural elements such as light, water, color, wind, soil and&amp;nbsp; the man made elements such as symbol and form, the holy figures, color and light in works and other works of art. The results of the research suggest that the viewpoint of both groups emphasize on conduction of meanings and concepts and the reminding role in urban elements but the difference is in the type of attitude and perception. That is common people have been weaker than professionals (students and architecture and urbanization engineers) in perception of symbols and desired signs of designers and this stresses on the necessity of&amp;nbsp; strengthening the more popular, the more indigenous and the more comprehensible&amp;nbsp; elements. And besides this, the respondents also stressed on the necessity of considering the natural elements and elements which have functionality in addition to meaning and beauty. Thus, architecture, the framework of city and the elements of urban beautification as components of daily life space will have considerable role in this reminding aspect. Designing the urban elements in line with creation of Reminiscence space can be defined according to different parameters like: attention to historical dates, customs and culture of the society, attention to revelations and accounts and divine names and immaculate Imams, attention to architecture and the identity of the region and so on. In other words, there will be different interpretations and perceptions according to the place of designing.

	<Abstract>Iran's history boasts valuable experiences that are evident in various fields of economic, social, war and defense, management, architecture, urbanism, and so on. Transferring this experience to the next generations and applying them is an important step towards improving the country. The Iran&amp;ndash;Iraq War (the Holy Defense), as a successful experience in management and also a national movement is a valuable event which plays more important role than others. The experiences of military engineering during this time period could significantly affect any practical and management field, especially on the city management and renovation of urban deteriorated area. In this article, according to field studies and researches which are conducted by the author, it is provided to document the events and complete the studies in renovation of urban deteriorated area. The main purpose is to enrich the capacity of renovation planning, by employee the experiences of military engineering in the duration of the holy defense. The lessons learned from warfare engineering can be summarized in adopting the Normative-scientific approach to manage the renovation of urban deteriorated areas. This new approach has emphasized on some principles that adopted according to Iranian-Islamic culture based on a special value, scientific and experimental oriented managerial approach. Leading and creative thinking, interactive participation, reliability in the way to action, learning while doing, and redefining the foundations and transformation of practices are the main elements of this approach.

	<Abstract>It has been said that the legislation of rules and regulations, has been affected the form, construction and the relationship between different forms of life in residential buildings. In the city of Tehran, the occupancy code along with the regulation of construction exactly in the northern 60 present of plot with the feasibility of projection for 2 meters, considering beveled corners (45 degree), was one of the codes legislated for the common row type houses. It seems that this code had a lot of effect on Tehran&amp;rsquo;s residential areas which created a type of housing called row houses. In this type we can distinguish two different species called the northern houses and the southern one. There are obvious differences between these two types that know to be as a reason of the regulation specially the construction portion and its beveled corners. Howbeit the beveled corners are not obligatory any more but we can see its effect on city image. Row type houses along with its northern and southern species with the high of three to six stories is defined as the common residential building patterns of Tehran&amp;rsquo;s houses. Because of this dominance in Tehran as a capital and then in all Iranian cities, it is very important to address this issue as a research topic. So in this research we are going to investigate around the effect of these kinds of regulation and codes on residential buildings. The question arises here is that to what extent this code can influence Tehran&amp;rsquo;s housing. The main question of this research is to realize the effect of the 60 percent occupancy of the plot with a possibility of 2 meters projection on residential areas in three scales including residential unit&amp;rsquo;s itself, its surroundings and other residential buildings and its neighborhood to have a comprehensive study. For the three above mentioned scales, three type of characteristics covering the quality of architecture mentioned by capon, has been selected which consist of performance-behavior, structure and building physics and perception-space. Then these characteristics have been evaluated in available Tehran&amp;rsquo;s samples of row houses. The characteristics and the scales shape a matrix which forms the theoretical Framework of this research. So this frame work used to evaluate the effect of this code. Therefore each of the 9 portions of the framework matrix filled by three instances of effects. With a help of logical reasoning as a research method of this paper, the effects of 60 percent plus 2 meters projection code, has been evaluated through this framework. All the 27 effects which have been founded, consist of day lighting factors, view and landscape, overlook through the triangular balcony created because of the beveled corners, etc. categorised in three main groups of overlook, the quality of day lighting and spatial proportions. These three factors can seriously affect the quality of living in each residential units or apartments which has been increased by solely a code called 60 percent plus 2 meters.

	<Abstract>The typology of factors affecting identity and location is one of the important issues that play a major role in creating lively spaces and enjoying favorable living conditions for citizens and residents of cities especially in metropolitan areas; if the authentication of a site allows the individual to Space is safer and more relaxed. In this article, the study of this hypothesis is descriptive-analytic, and the factors of identity recognition of the sense of place in the structure of the neighborhoods have been introduced in the light of the theory of the neighborhood. The meta-analysis method is also followed by the compilation of the research and theories in this field. Is taken into consideration. Findings of the research show that recognition, familiarity and subjective dominance on the identity and sense of space in space not only do not require a great deal of perception, but the relief and sense of identity and sense of place in the use of local space If the sensation of action and readability of space is necessary for this space with space. At the end, the components and indicators of authentication and sense of place are briefly mentioned.

	<Abstract>A review of the literature reveals place attachment as the most popular term used. This led the diversity and requires classification of studies. The purpose of the research is that the most affecting factor of Place Attachment between Place Identity, Place Dependence, Place Affective and Place Social Bonding specified and therefore has been implemented to combine a number of quantitative studies in the field of Place Attachment as the effect size of each factor affecting the structure of place attachment calculated through the summary effect. In order to study the main purpose of the research, the method of meta-analysis is used and scientific articles published in Persian and English, without place and time limitation, have formed the study population. A total of 49 primary articles achieved by looking in magazines indexed in databases: Taylor &amp; Fracis, Science Direct, Wiley, Proquest, Magiran and Sid with the key words of &amp;quot;Place attachment ultimately 18 articles obtained in order to perform a Meta-Analysis. To perform statistical calculations and analysis of the results, the software of Comprehensive Meta Analysis V2 has been used. Hheterogeneity between studies was assessed by using this software and according to the result of the Q Cochran test, the random model is used to extract the summary effect. The results show that the Place Affective is the most important factor in the assessment of Place Attachment and then Place Identity, Place Social Bonding and Place Dependence are located.

	<Abstract>Tehran as the political and administrative center of the country, the concentration of economic and industrial activities, the concentration and concentration of the population, the density and concentration of the population, access to the transportation network and communication routes (the center of the crossroads of railways, roads E &amp; A), the focus of financial, credit and banking institutions is one of the most important provinces in the country. The area of Tehran, located in the southern foothills of the central Alborz Mountains, is considered one of the most viable areas in Iran. Seismic activity of Tehran and adjacent areas due to Alborz folding and faults in this range. The present study is based on available sources of springs, earthquakes and seismic parameters related to springs. It is evident that, with more extensive information and more precise mechanical data inputs, Tehran's seismic zoning pattern can change. slow. Finally, due to the large number of faults in Tehran and the historical records of the activity of these faults, we will find that there will be a massive earthquake in Tehran not far away.

	<Abstract>In most of international carriage conventions and national regulations, in order to protect the parties, especially carrier, short period of time for actions arising out of carriage is determined, so that the attainment of lapse of time is considered as one of the causes of exemption from the liability of carrier. The issue of this writing is investigation of different dimensions of lapse of time in land carriage regulations (rail and road) of Iran and a number of the important international conventions on transport of goods and passenger by road and rail, namely; CMR, CVR, CIM and CIV. Dimensions such as scope, period of time, starting point, suspention, interruptions of lapse of time are regarded in this writing. The results of investigations show that great similarities exist among the discussed conventions, concerning the regulations of lapse of time. In addition, between the mentioned conventions and Iran&amp;rsquo;s legal system, it can be mentioned that suitable similarities exist between Iran&amp;rsquo;s legal system and the mentioned conventions in the regulations of prescription of goods carriage (not passenger carriage) in spite of a number of differences, such as, lapse of time of body injuries resulted from carriage of passenger.

	<Abstract>The historical context of Kerman makes a valuable collection of urban texture and architecture of Iran, which has considerable properties regarding architecture and urbanism. Among the issues associated with semiotics is how architectural semiotic layers (text / context) are related to stability and dynamic architecture or systematic instability of architecture. In order to explain this in the current paper, besides describing the concepts of iconic, symbolic and indexical semiotics, aesthetic and social semiotic codes that are affected by the above concepts are also introduced. Then, three major approaches of semiotics, namely, Syntagmatic relation, Paradigmatic relation and cultural semiotics are explained; it is also determined how the constructed layers of the codes affected by this approach may strengthen, dynamite or destroy the system of the urban architecture and context of the studied area located in the historical context of Kerman. Accordingly semiotic analysis of the desired text / context in both past and contemporary period will determine how different constructing layers of the traditional text / context are increasingly and contextually related, and adversely, how in the current state, due to the disrupted relation of layers, including structural, functional, aesthetic and conceptual relation, the results syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations of these layers caused separation and perturbation of the contextual system. At the end of the article, it is recommended that to strengthen the system and create a coherent and functional tissue, it is required to cognition and congruence of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations in different layers of text / tissue.

	<Abstract>Environmental protection and prevention of environmental events are among the most important programs of policy institutions in the world today, and therefore, environmental policies are prioritized by national and international institutions. In Iran, a series of parliamentary talks has been devised in the form of plans and bills to the environment. These negotiations are usually influenced by approaches that are called environmental discourses in environmental sociology. This paper attempts to examine the extent of compliance of the members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly with the global patterns of environmental discourse. The present study examines the negotiations of MPs through a qualitative approach. The method has been used to adapt the negotiations to the global patterns of environmental discourse, documentary and data quality analysis, means the documents and research data, including the talks of representatives of the seven sessions of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, were studied. The negotiation process of the delegates indicates that most of the negotiations are in line with the Brulle and then Hanygan patterns, and, in the end, with the Herndel &amp; Brown model. But at the same time, there are talks that are influenced by the conditions of Iran and do not adapt to global patterns.

	<Abstract>This study is an attempt to determine the factors affecting the architectural typology as possible by abstracting the species, achieving the proper patterns and provide comprehensive architectural design. For this purpose, using documentary and descriptive methods, a variety of methods, criteria and indicators analyzed and criticized and typology has been developed theoretical foundations. The study shows that each of the methods and indicators in the field of typology enough not comprehensive and architectural features such as fully affected by the indexes are, as examples of subsets of a particular species, different behaviors in terms of architectural features of the show. So with the aim of achieving full and maximum comprehensiveness of the typology to develop criteria and indicators as a parameter based on the characteristics of architectural composition action. In the process of any of the standard features of the composition of each sample in terms of index composition was analyzed and the following sub-classified and then a comparative analysis of the matching between the groups classified and Species based on sub-samples are compared to each sub-factors the maximum frequency are extracted. The results show the method to obtain the sample species belonging to the same treatment as it has all the features of their architecture. Another point is that this method can achieve the process of reviewing its options and reproduction of the species.

	<Abstract>&amp;ldquo;Spatial capital&amp;rdquo; as a relatively new concept in urban studies has been employed by researchers in various fields such as urban geography, urban design, sociology and urban economy, in the last 2 decades. Unfortunately, most of this research is not highly interconnected, and there is still ambiguity around the concept and its criteria; which makes it hard to grasp and explain both in terms of its relationship to concrete spatial factors such as form, density, legibility, accessibility, land use, mobility, etc., and its exchange with other types of capital as well. This research aims to provide a conceptual framework and a comprehensive definition of spatial capital, through a systematic review of all the relevant literature. It explores the roots of this concept and analyzes the commonalities and differences between various relevant studies and their definitions of spatial capital. The findings of this research show that the core elements of spatial capital are proximity and distance, which are influenced by nodality, accessibility, mobility, connectivity, and spatial competence of the actors. This research defines spatial capital as the value-added of space which represents itself through the stocks of spatial capital, and the flows of spatial capital. The spatial capital could be bonding or bridging based on how inclusive it is in relation to spatial actors. This research provides a complex, open and loose framework that shows the role of various physical, spatial, social, economic factors in the form of an urban assemblage called spatial capital. The spatial distance from the centers of capital accumulation and The spatial distance from the centers of capital accumulation and center of concentration of the owners of these capitals (in terms of dwelling, or using the space in any shape or form) could be summed up in three approaches to distance which are temporal, physical, and social distance.

	<Abstract>Building is related to the city in every respect. They are a natural response to the accumulation of population and cost of land. Building will be resulted to justify his answer to the concept of the design and building results. Buildings in the city in terms of resistance and stability need to take advantage of structural systems are appropriate. Steel sheer wall system is interesting to researchers for the good performance in absorbing lateral forces such as earthquakes and for this reason used in normal and high-rise buildings in earthquake-prone countries is used. In few cases, it is unavoidable to make openings because of applying architecture and beautification&amp;rsquo;s needs and also nonstructural considerations like position and path of installation systems. Requirements openings in Steel shear wall system like all structural systems are necessary to the terms of architecture and design considerations. In these cases openings must be large enough in size and number so they can be used in the cases cited. The creation of such large openings could severely change the stress distribution within the wall and often the failure mode affects the behavior of the wall loaded. The main question of this article is the causes off multiple openings and the behavior of steel shear wall system with multiple openings. In this article the effect of the position and arrangement of multiple openings on the behavior of this type of wall has been studied in terms of performance by using nonlinear dynamic analysis. For this purpose a set of seven earthquake ground motions were appropriately selected and applied to the systems and the results were analyzed.

	<Abstract>The excellence of each society depends on meeting the basic needs of those people. If any person has a decent job and housing in his life, he will feel comfortable with an efficient and comprehensive social security structure and adequate security and the law-enforcement community. The people of such a community will have considerable potential for excellence and, if there is proper planning in these societies, scientific progress, development, wealth generation, and the pioneering economy and, most importantly, human dignity will be decisive. In all societies, income diversification is inevitable among people, and naturally, people with appropriate income are able to meet their different needs, but low-income groups without the support of governments will not be able to meet their basic needs, including housing. Therefore, planning to support this group is a prerequisite for social justice and, at the same time, necessary for the development of a progressive and balanced society. So, in order to realize this, this paper has addressed the need for housing for low-income groups over the next 25 years. To do this, first all the characteristics of the target group are determined and then the number of required housing is estimated by the end of the year. The importance of estimating the number of residential units needed for the future is very important in estimating the funds needed to build these residential units, as well as for proper management and financing, and, on the other hand, provides the necessary housing and, on the other hand, promotes market growth and prosperity. Housing will be.

	<Abstract>Event between architecture and earlier context is one of the most important issues in the field of architecture and urban planning. The issue originate from the ancient thinking about placement of building in vicinity of the adjacent ones. Concerning the valuable concepts, one may achieve worthwhile architecture tailored to its cultural and historic as context, through the reading of historical, cultural and social text. In this study, we are going to define the context and explain planning methods such as conceptualism and regionalism, which are direct response to planning background. In next section valuable buildings of different eras (from the first Pahlavi to modern times) have been selected, in order to recognize the time architects approaches to the context. In addition, the earlier context impressibility would be investigated in these buildings. The main problem of the study is the proof of the distinction between regionalism and conceptualism approaches. Research method is proportional to the hypotheses, i.e. analytical-comparative method. Data collection method and the instrument for achieving theoretical bases of the study including data related to backgrounds and approaches such as regionalism and conceptualism was library studies. Then analytical and comparative studies were applied to analyze the case studies, along with presence in the environment, field studies and photography. The results of the study reveal that regionalism and conceptualism planning methods are distinctive. That is conceptualism acts on smaller scale relative to the site and its neighborhood and regionalism acts in larger scale, at national and regional levels.

	<Abstract>Water contamination is one of the important problems and challenges facing the world, including Iran. It is one of the main causes of death and mortality in the world. Surface and ground waters are both exposed to various contaminants. The contaminants have been classified into various categories, based on their nature, the source of contamination, and whether they are man-made or occur naturally. The main organic contaminants of water are agricultural, chemical, oil, and food contaminants. Each of these four groups has sub-criteria. In this research, investigation, identification, and accurate ranking of water contaminants in oil and petrochemical industries have been done using the factor analysis and analytical hierarchy process methods. The results of the factor analysis method suggest that the contaminants nitrate, sodium, and TDS have claimed the highest score from environmental experts as water contaminating agents. Further, the results of the ANP showed that agricultural and oil contaminants, with weights of 0.321 and 0.152, have been ranked first and fourth, respectively. In this research, following an investigation and ranking of water contaminants in oil and petrochemical industries, using factor analysis and ANP methods, a mathematical model was presented and then solved using goal programming with the aim of predicting and extracting the main contaminants and their levels in the oil and petrochemical industry and decreasing the environmental contaminants. The researchers hope that the presentation of the findings to relevant organizations, an effective step is taken to prevent environmental destruction by the contaminants of this industry.

	<Abstract>This research investigates the role of nature in residential complexes, in sense of freshness and happiness of residents, by examining case studies in Ekbatan complex in Tehran and mehregan complex in Qazvin. (In this study, happiness was examined from two point of views) The first is subjected to individual and is related to culture, insight and understanding of people and the two views are interrelated and affect each other. Then factors affecting the happiness were studied. It is important to note that the role of nature in creating happiness is basic and undeniable. Nature, as one of the factors in the design of open spaces in these complexes can be useful in the sense of vitality and calm environment and reduction of machine spirit of modernity. Eventually, the impact of nature in Ekbatan and Mehregan complexes were examined through questionnaires the result of questionnaires showed that high level of nature in Ekbatan has very significant impact on sense of happiness of people in the complex, and also the slight nature in Mehregan complex has very little impact on the sense of happiness of people Mehregan complex. According to the concept of happiness and factors affecting it, we shall say, the open nature of the residential complexes, as a gathering place, causes better so social interactions and better relationships between users, which will lead to greater happiness of the residents. In the past architectures, in order to perform these interactions, the naure in the yard was used but, in today`s residential complex, there is less attention regarding meaning and quality of environment. With regards to the requirements of modern life &amp;quot;shortage and sometimes lack of natural elements, rush hours, noise pollution, advanced technology, fading close emotional relations of the resident in most good neighborly relations in residential complexes, and followed by social anomalies(crime) and identity crisis in settlements requires attention to the construction of residential areas with natural elements, for creating space for social interaction(more and better understanding of users towards each other) has attracted researcher`s view. We can also say, nature as factor that can canes social, cultural, psychotically mobility of people in residential complexes, has been considered in this study. And according to the belief that man is part of the nature, causes his survival, and this valuable relationship is emphasized is emphasized in Islamic teaching is one of the main points in this study the methodology described in this research is qualitative.

	<Abstract>Persian gardens, whose background dates back to the Achaemenid dynasty have always been influenced by some of the main characteristics of Iran's culture, religion and civilization in design onone hand and, on the other hand the environmental conditions. The general pattern of the design of these gardens has been based on Charbaghi design since the beginning of the Achaemenid rule until the end of the Qajar period; however, by the end of Qajar period and from the beginning of the Pahlavi era, this type of design pattern is influenced by the modernity and Western architectural style. Also, the retrieval of the concepts inherent in the Iranian gardens requires the recognition of the religion and their views on nature and the main characteristics of the ideal paradise per each. Hence, the current paper aims to explore the features and patterns of garden design as well as the effective factors in shaping them since the beginning of the Achaemenid rule to the end of the Pahlavi era. This is an analytical - descriptive research with a historical and deductive approach. Data was collected purposefully using library tools and research studies. The results of the current paper show that the formation of urban parks during the first Pahlavi period in Iran has been caused by different domestic and foreign factors. On the other hand, the first urban parks in Tehran and Iran have been influenced by Western landscape architectural styles. In a general conclusion, Iranian gardens are cultural, historical, and physical phenomena in the territory of Iran. Also, in most texts related to the gardens of the Islamic period, reference is made to paradise in their design. In this school, natural elements such as water and plants are considered as divine signs, and they are of such importance that repeatedly referred to in Islamic texts.

	<Abstract>In this study, we have tried to estimate the impact of investment shocks on output in manufacturing industries of Iran. In this research, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model is applied for the period starting from 1374 to 1393. To achieve more reliable and comparable results, we have categorized industries into three groups, namely resource base, low technology, medium and high technology. Using Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decomposition Analysis, the results show that investment shocks have a significant impact on all three sample industrial groups. In other words, capital increase grows value added of Iranian industries in both short-run and long-run.

	<Abstract>Although the principles of Islam are fixed and irreversible truths that have been laid down for all time, but the farewell is high and ijtihad is necessary. That is, at any time and time, it is necessary for specialist experts to adapt the principles of Islam to the changing issues that occur in time, and to determine what these issues are based on. It is evident that the principles laid down for the housing laid down from this The rule is not an exception and should be recognized and adapted to the rules and conditions of the time. The Islamic teachings presented in the Holy Qur'an and the Word of the Innocents (PBUH) provide conceptual and practical strategies in the form of metaphysical and metaphysical principles that can be exploited, since Islamic teachings on biological spaces such as Housing has a very positive and positive effect, so studying and researching is important in this regard. This research studies the role of Islamic teachings in how to form a residential environment. In this study, Islamic teachings as religious beliefs and values of residents of the home are an independent variable that influences the physical structure of the home as a dependent variable. Following the detailed study of Islamic teachings from the Quranic verses and authentic Hadiths, the effect of these factors and its manifestation in the case examples has been carefully considered. The research method is descriptive-analytic and has been done by choosing traditional analgesics in a warm and dry climate in Iran. The results of the research show that the spatialization of home and housing in Islam is proportional to their material and spiritual needs and is in fact based on Islamic teachings. Therefore, based on these teachings, the apparent identity of housing is in harmony with material needs, and the religious identity of housing is consistent with the spiritual needs of man.

The first group includes the heads and assistant heads of human resources management of the National Iranian Gas Company in the amount of 30 people, and the second group includes all the official staff of the National Iranian Gas Company in the amount of 18802 people. Using the Cochran formula, 377 samples Statistics were selected. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaires was calculated using Cronbach's alpha and their validity was determined using two methods: content validity and construct validity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential methods such as correlation coefficient test, single-variable t test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, based on the analysis of the native and effective system of the system Compensation in accordance with the general policies of the administrative system was fitted and presentedAlso, the results of the research show that there is a significant relationship between the compensation system and its components with the dependent variable, the model of the effectiveness of the compensation system, and also there is a significant relationship between the general policies of the administrative system and the dependent variable, the model of the effectiveness of the compensation system.

	<Abstract>In order to prepare for environmental changes, foresight studies have replaced conventional and traditional planning techniques. In contrast to predictions, futures and scenario activities (as one of the most important foresight methods) focus on uncertainties that decision-makers cannot control or reduce. Scenario planning is a technique that provides different perspectives with regard to environmental uncertainties. Scenarios present the future that is likely to occur in the form of stories, provide alternative about future-related situations. In this research, the development scenarios of the Kohgiloyeh and Boyerahmad Province have been addressed. For this purpose, the Delphi method and the expert&amp;rsquo;s panel as local knowledge have been used to identify the driving forces and future uncertainties. The future development scenarios of the province were developed using the Cross-Impact Matrix and MickMak software. The results show that Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad province faces two critical uncertainties of Economic Structure and Fiscal Development. Considering the scenario logics, the province faces four development scenarios in the future.
