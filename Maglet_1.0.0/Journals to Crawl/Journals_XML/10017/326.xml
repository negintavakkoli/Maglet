				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The foundation of desirable commanding model is considered as one of the key factors in governing of the country, and it is one of the most important factors for meeting the deadlines presented in the outlook document of Islamic Republic of Iran in the horizon of 1404. The basic aim of this study is presenting a desirable commanding model from perspective of Islam and Imam Khamenei's statements. Identifying key and basic factors in applied research in the field of Islamic commanding and management seem to be inevitable in near future. The first step for this purpose is investigating and summation of previous studies in the field of desirable commanding. This study aimed at recognition of the present state about the past studies using the qualitative method of Meta–analysis and Shannon entropy. For this purpose, the presented articles (68 articles) in the previous conference titled: Presenting desirable commanding pattern from the perspective of Islam and statements of the supreme leader of Iran, held at Imam Ali (P.B.U.H) University, were used. From among the whole number of articles, the five top articles were selected and analyzed. Data analysis was conducted based on open coding methods (84 Codes). After analyzing 84 code, similar codes were classified in 34 categories and 4 main classes. The four main categories included: spiritual, administrative, military, individual and behavioral categories. The results showed that the spiritual category is the most effective factor in desirable commanding and management and three other factors rank next subsequently.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Nowadays, the enemies of Islam, who are trying to stain Islam and holy prophet's face through misgivings like bellicosity, racism, organizing terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc., plan for Islamophobia among nations and prevent spreading of Islam through the world and through people's hearts. A study of narrative resources and bases reveals that the holy prophet (P.B.U.H), during his 10-year-ruling in Median, had 85 battles in which he, himself managed the battle personally, and he had 34 fights in which he assigned some commanders instead of himself to manage the war. In all of these battles, the holy prophet ordered his soldiers and followers to respect humanitarianism rights and munificence. In the present study the following question was to be answered: What are the basic principles of humanitarianism rights from holy prophet's military approach? The research was fundamental research in terms of purpose, descriptive-analytic in terms of research method and qualitative in terms of nature. Library research and field notes from narrative resources were employed as data collection procedures. The gathered data were analyzed through content analysis. According to the collected data, the basic principles of humanitarianism rights from holy prophet's military approach were categorized as 52 sub-categories, 22 categories and 10 principles in the form of a conceptual model in terms of mundane and spiritual aspects.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Climate is one of the most important geographical factors in defensive and military affairs which should always be taken into consideration by designers in the defensive and military fields in choosing doctrines, tactics, and even in choosing the type of military forces, clothes, logistics, maintenance and installations. A challenge for strategic commanders in long term planning is knowledge of climatic calendar of various zones. In the present research, for zoning and evaluation of climatic conditions of Sistan and Baluchestan Province in terms of military operations, all synoptic stations of the region were studied. From among them, seven stations which had a statistical period of higher than 30 years were chosen. The climatic data regarding temperature, relative moisture, speed and direction of the wind, cloudiness, vision field, daily and monthly rainfall and snowfall were taken from the organization of meteorology. Then, the threshold of effective climatic elements in military operations were identified, and the probabilities of effective parameters on military operations were calculated. In addition, using physiologic equivalent temperature, climatic welfare and effective cold and warm tensions on military forces during various months were evaluated. Furthermore, based on the indicator of military climate, the condition of the region was studied for its climatic desirability for various military operations during year. The findings revealed that the level of desirability of south east region of Iran in terms of military climate was low during warm and summer season, and it was high during cold and moderate season of the year. The least level of climatic desirability for military operations was found to be in Tir and Mordad. Furthermore, form among the stations in this province, the least desirable stations for military operations were found to be Zabol and Zahak which are affected by 120-day wind storms of Sistan. On the opposite, the highest desirability for military climate was found to be in Aban, Mehr and Esfand, and the stations of Chabahr, and Saravan enjoyed the most desirable defensive climate during these months.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Manpower and its management are among the non-physical factors that affect the combat power of the armed forces. Accordingly, this research was an attempt to identify and prioritize human resources management practices which affect organizational identification to increase the combat power of the armed forces. This research is descriptive-survey in terms of purpose, and is applied research in terms of its type of use. From among employees working in an industrial defense unit in Tehran, a sample of 350 were chosen through simple random sampling. After designing and determining the validity and reliability of the tool, a structural equation model was used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that identity making policies, ethical leadership styles, identity making tools and skills, and identity making policies are among human resource management practices that affect organizational identification. In addition, the findings showed that organizational identification affects the non-physical factors of combat power. Hence, managers and commanders must create organizational identification through employee engagement, empowerment, development of working groups, leadership ethical styles, and satisfactory communications, and through these practices they can increase the non-physical combat power of the armed forces.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Nowadays, there is an increasing need in military systems for more intelligent and higher semantic interactions, efficient transfer of military information, and developing a common language among forces for synchronized decision making and a coordinated action. In the same vein, ontology has become an innovative tool for military information modelling. In the present paper, using an innovative methodology which is a combination of knowledge engineering and automatic methods of data derivation, and with the purpose of modelling of military knowledge for developing a common semantic infrastructure for commanding and control systems, as well as a common language among forces, the ontology of battle field was modelled in three sub-ontologies of military, geographical and civil branches using Protégé software in OWL language. Finally, the developed ontology was evaluated using a comprehensive verification plan for coverage and credibility and correctness of ontology application. The developed ontology is the first domestic ontology which is applicable as semantic infrastructure for various command and control systems.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Student pilots and flight engineers have to pass aviation English. In Army Aviation Training Center Academy (A.A.T.C. A), this course is taught by EFL instructors and field specialists or subject teachers. In this study, the cognitions and practices of these two groups of teachers were explored. Four EFL instructors and four subject teachers (two pilots and two flight engineers) teaching in A.A.T.C.A were surveyed. Semi-structured interviews, field notes, and unobtrusive classroom observations were employed in order to probe into their underlying cognitions and teaching practices. Analysis of the gathered data revealed substantial inconsistencies among the subject teachers and the EFL instructors. The divergence between the two is related to a number of factors. The results of a series of independent-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant difference between the two groups of teachers as far as their durations of group/pair work activities, first language use, and TTT are concerned. To examine the practices of Aviation Field Specialist (AFS) and EFL teachers in terms of the frequency of using pair-group work, questioning, corrective feedback types and pre, during and post language skill activities, the researcher ran the normality test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov and found the distribution of scores far from normal. Therefore, Mann-Whitney U test was used. The findings demonstrated a significant difference among these teachers in all the investigated variables. Implications for EAP teacher education programs were discussed. Some new ideas for reflection in aviation English instruction are also suggested in this paper. ]]></dcterms:abstract>
