This paper discusses the identification of the causal circumstances of city branding and the analysis of its consequences and impacts in two qualitative and quantitative phases. The extracted model is based on the qualitative research method of data theory, using theoretical sampling method, and in the quantitative phase, city branding outcomes were investigated based on correlation method. The results of this study showed that, on the one hand, city branding is influential as a predictor variable for creating an ideal image and also on the level of satisfaction of residents living as criterion variables, and on the other hand, it has a direct and significant impact on audience satisfaction level including tourists.</field></doc></add>
