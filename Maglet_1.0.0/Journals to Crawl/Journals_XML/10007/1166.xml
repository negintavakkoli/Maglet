The proposed model schools ranked theoretical and mathematical description is composed of two parts. This model utilizes the model of the Balanced Scorecard, developed its shape or conceptual cross section of the rating model, the recall is complete. All the research community to the city of Qazvin is no ordinary high school. A total of 177 patients were collected points.
