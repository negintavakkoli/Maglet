title = {Evaluation of geomechanical characteristics of Asmary limestone in Khersan dam sites}, 
abstract ={Abstract (Paper pages 1059-1076) Physical and mechanical properties of intact rocks are very important in civil engineering works that interact with rock such as underground structures, dams,foundations on rock, and rock slopes. Therefore geomechanical parameters such as compression strength and deformation modulus of rock can have fundamental importance in the different stages of design. Determination of these parameters is time consuming and costly. Since Asmary formation has broad outcrop in the west and southwest of Iran and many large projects are located in this formation, therefore it is a requirement to accomplish the present research. This paper is dealing to analyzing data from laboratory of two major projects of the Khersan 1 and 2 dam sites. In this regard, the physical, mechanical, dynamic and durability properties of intact rock and geology controlling agents of these changes has been evaluated and analyzed. Finally, new experimental relations between different parameters have been presented.},

abstract ={Schmidt hammer is used for calculation of joint compressive strength and elasticity modulus of rocks. Today, application of Schmidt hammer is a common method in evaluation of properties of rocks. This method is quick, inexpensive and non-destructive which are benefits of this method. In this regard, different experimental equations proposed by Barton &#38; Choubey (1977), Deere (1960), Keadbinski (1980), Aufmuth (1973) and ISRM (1981) can be employed in order to calculate the Joint Compressive Strength (JCS) of rocks. Due to the importance of this research, new experimental equations are introduced. Using this equations show a very good results in comparison with the results of other researchers. It should be noted that this equations are achieved from 827 records of Schmidt Hammer results from different types of hard rocks such as granite, diorite and hornfels from the Ganjnameh-Shahrestaneh road in Hamedan province, west of Iran.},

abstract ={Rock fall hazard assessment is a fundamental land-use planning tool in high mountain area, where human settlements progressively develop across side valley areas, using the worth of potential losses and the restoration costs. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of rock falls along the north east of the Yadak village. This village is located in the Khorasan-Razavi province near the Ghochan city in the northeast of Iran. The existence of the Tirgan limestones with abundant joints and fractures in the north part of the Yadak village causes instability such as rock falls that provide many problems for the residents. Many factors such as rock type, slope morphology, drainage pattern and the seismic activity are considered in this research as affecting factors. For joints investigation in the study area, the dip and dip direction of more than 180 discontinuities measured and analyzed using dips. Since most of the slope instability along the north part of the Yadak village are the rock falls type. Rocfall software was used to investigate the rock fall mechanism. Finally, the rock fall hazard zonation map is prepared using GIS program.},

title = {Development of a simplified image processing technique for determining crack intensity factor of compacted clayey soils}, 
abstract ={Desiccation cracking commonly occurring in compacted clayey soils typically used as landfill liners can result in poor hydraulic performance of the liner. In this research, a simplified image processing technique was developed in order to characterize desiccation cracking intensity in compacted clayey soils. Three pairs of compacted clayey soils were studied in a relatively large scale experiment to evaluate the effect of geotextile cover on desiccation cracking under real-time atmospheric conditions. Digital images were taken from the surface of soils at certain time intervals for 10 months and were analyzed to determine crack intensity factor (CIF). The key parameter in identification of cracks as accurately as possible was found to be sensitivity. Calibration process was based on using %20 of the images with different crack intensities whose crack dimensions and therefore CIF values have been already measured to compare to program output. A calibration coefficient for sensitivity was accordingly determined based on the average difference between the sensitivity introduced by the program and the actual sensitivity calculated based on an overlaying process. Result of verification of this methodology indicated that it can be reliably used to determine CIF of compacted clay soils in a simple yet accurate manner.},

title = {Estimating mechanical properties of limestone from petrophysical data}, 
abstract ={Abstract (Paper pages 1159-1178) Young’s modulus measured as the slope of the stress-strain curve under static loading conditions (Es) in the lab is one of the most essential parameters for reservoir geomechanical modeling. However, information on the value of Es along the well length is often discontinuous and limited to cross well with the core. On the other hand, well log data for wave velocities Vp and Vs are often available for most hydrocarbon reservoirs. Hence, well-known equations are needed to calculate static Young’s modulus based on the compressional and shear wave velocities (Vp and Vs) that is dynamic Young’s modulus (Ed). Unfortunately, because of porosity and micro cracks in rock texture, Es and Ed are not equal. Therefore, correlation between static and dynamic parameters could result in a continuous and more reliable knowledge on the elastic parameters along the well length. In this research, laboratory experiments were carried out on limestone rock core specimens of Sarvak formation obtained from an oil well in the South West of Iran. Empirical relations were suggested to estimate UCS and static Young’s modulus from compressional wave velocity (Vp) and dynamic Young’s modulus. These empirical relations are prerequisite for continuous wellbore stability analysis in oil and gas well drilling},

abstract ={All rockfill materials subjected to stresses above the normal geotechnical ranges exhibit considerable particle breakage. Particle breakage and crushing of the large particles to smaller ones result in a lower strength and higher deformability. The breakage of particle that is observed in the large scale triaxial tests, is usually expressed quantitatively by the Marsal breakage index, . This paper presents a method for calculating at any axial strain level in the large triaxial tests. The model used Rowe’s minimum energy principle ratio. The key parameter in modeling , is the friction angle which excludes dilation and breakage effects, . The results indicate that the internal friction angles at confining pressure equal and less than 200 kPa at the constant volume state is a unique value. Moreover, there is a linear relationship between the variation of energy spent on particle breakage to Marsal Breakage index with confining pressure, at failure axial strain.},

abstract ={Tunnel boring machines (TBM) are widely used in excavating urban tunnels. These kinds of machines have different types based on supporting faces and tunnel walls. One type of these machines, is the Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) type that was used in excavating the Line 1 Tunnel of Tabriz Metro. Different parameters such as geological conditions, rock mass properties, dip and machine specifications affect the efficiency of the machine. One method of predicting the efficiency of these machines is to estimate their penetration rates. In this study the value of TBM penetration rates are predicted by an artificial neural network. Predicting of this parameter is so effective for conducting in high risk regions by understanding the time of facing to these regions. The main result of this study is to forecast the penetration rate with an acceptable accuracy and to determine the effective parameters through sensitivity analysis measured by an artificial neural network.},

title = {Prediction of ground movements around tunnel due to excavation by EPB machines (Case study three line of Tehran subway)}, 
abstract ={The development of large cities requires the use the underground networks for the construction of transportation infrastructures and facilities. Construction of tunnels in soft grounds induces generally soil movement, which could seriously affect the stability and integrity of existing structures. In order to reduce such movements, in particular in urban areas, contractors use more and more the tunnel boring machines (TBM) for the construction of tunnels. Hence in urban environment, Prediction of the ground movements caused by the tunnel excavation is a major engineering challenge. In this paper is used a three-dimensional numerical model and ABAQUS cod for the prediction of soil movements induced during tunnel construction in part of the line 3 of Tehran subway using EPB excavation machine. This investigation include most shield tunneling components such as face pressure, the grouting pressure, excavation machine and frictional contact with soil and shield. Observations of the results demonstrate that the maximum surface settlement in this section is 2.5 cm that is 0.5 cm more than the its allowable value. Simultaneously with surface settlements occur horizontal movements within soil mass, which have different forms in two horizontal directions, and with the expansion of depth they increasing.},

abstract ={In the karstic areas, detailed studies of phenomena such as seepage of water from hydraulic structures and land subsidence in the residential and quarry areas  is of  higher importance. In this study, the dissolution rate constant of gypsite samples of Gachsaran Formation, obtained from the Chamshir dam reservoir, were measured equal to 0.24×10-3 cm/sec. Then, the changes of amounts of joint apertures using theoretical and experimental (by changes of joint water flowing and direct measurement) methods were calculated. The results showed that the predicted aperture for joints calculated through theoretical method is less consistent with the measured value of the changes of joint water flowing while the value measured by direct method (measured using a caliper) compliance is higher. Also based on research findings, if gypsites of the dam reservoir are exposed to the water flow, the amount of aperture of a joint with 0.5 cm initial opening will increase to 10 cm after about 278 days. This increase in joint aperture compared with the useful life of the dam draws for special attention to water tightening of dam reservoir.},

abstract ={In this paper, using Mononobe &#38; Okabe method, seismic force and its effects on thin masonry retaining wall inside structural frame (Masonry retaining infill) are presented. In this method, retaining wall has been assumed to be rigid and the prevailing failure mode is sliding of wall bed joint or wall rotation around its toe, whereas the prevailing failure mode of masonry retaining infill is usually flexural cracking in middle zone of wall under out of plane seismic force. In this case, the seismic force distribution is important. Accordingly in this paper, a distribution for seismic forces on masonry retaining infill has been proposed. Also with regard to out of plane behavior of masonry retaining infill in terms of strength and acceptance criteria aspect, failure in body of wall due to out of plane loads has been analyzed. Then, the desired seismic rehabilitation method in case of vulnerable masonry retaining infills has been presented and as a practical example, results of the proposed method with the results of numerical software have been controlled. Finally, according to various conditions predicted for masonry retaining infills, Seismic Retrofit solutions are presented for practical applications.},

title = {Development of a New Method to Estimate Rock Strength Using Joint Factor}, 
abstract ={Discontinuities have properties such as orientation, number of set and frequency that can affect the rock strength. Rock specimens having one, two and three cross- sets of discontinuities, various frequencies and orientations of 0, 30, 45, 60 and 90 degrees were prepared. The numbers of rock pieces increased progressively with an increase of frequency and set of discontinuities. As specimens having three sets of discontinuities that one of their sets had four number of parallel discontinuities were consisted 20 rock pieces and they represented jointed rock mass. Joint factor, uniaxial compressive strength and friction angle along the discontinuity surface in direct shear were determined. The uniaxial compressive strength of specimens having one, two and three sets of discontinuities in horizontal and vertical direction was less than the uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock. The uniaxial compressive strength of specimens approached approximately to zero value particularly when the orientation of discontinuities was 60 degrees. This considerable decrease of strength was occurred also for specimens having two and three sets of discontinuities at orientation of 30 degrees. The analysis of results showed that the relationship between ratio of uniaxial compressive strength of jointed specimens to the uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock specimens (anisotropy factor) and joint factor of this research is considerably different with the suggested relationship by Ramamurthy. Properties of discontinuities have altogether essential role on the strength of rock mass.},
