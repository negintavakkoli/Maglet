			<abstract>This research presents urban flood risk management through new management approaches including the implementation of penetration trenches, permanent containment reservoirs and permeable pavements in the surface water collection network. The multi-objective optimization model presented in this research is based on the multi-objective MOPSO algorithm that is combined with Surface Surface Simulation Modeling Software by SWMM software. The application of the proposed method has been described on a case study of the Surface Surface Network of Tehran 22nd District, which consists of four different scenarios; the first scenario examines the performance of new management methods for improving surface runoff quantity without using BMP, and second scenarios, Third, and fourth, BMPs including penetrating trenches, permanent containment tanks and permeable pavements, which were applied in six, four and two percent of the sub basins for the return period of two, five and ten years, were used respectively. Modeling results show that biological storage tanks are more capable of reducing peak courier than penetration trenches and permeable pavements. Also, with the increase of the return period, the impact of BMPs decreases, so that the biosecurity tanks are 10% more effective than penetration trenches and about 20% more than penetrating pavements in reducing peak cours. The goal of the optimization model is to reduce peak coursing, which results suggest that using the optimal combination of all three new approaches leads to a 51% to 54% reduction in peak versus the most effective BMP.</abstract>

			<abstract>In this paper by performing of a series of triaxial cyclic test the effect of adding fines on the liquefaction potential of sandy soil are studied, after sampling of the soil and doing basic geotechnical tests on the samples. The result of triaxial cyclic tests showed that pure sandy soil after 54 cycle of loading is liquefied which prove the studied soil is liquefaction prone. Moreover it can be inferred from the test results that in low fine percent liquefaction resistance is decrease that can be attributed to breaking the coarse grain’s bond by fine particles. While by increasing the percent of the Kaolinite clay the soil liquefaction resistance is increase which can be explain by domination of the fine in soil structure and making soil more cohesive. This decreasing and increasing trend in soil resistance against liquefaction by adding fines is observed in several other studies which the percent of the fine that change the trend is named threshold fine amount. The result of the paper has been shown for studied sand of Noor city the threshold fine amount of Kaolinite clay is 12 weight percent.</abstract>

			<abstract>Nowadays, very important issues are considered by geological and mining engineers in extraction process of minerals. The important goals are: productivity and high production rates, improve working conditions and lower operating costs. The most suitable option to achieve these goals is to replace the traditional extraction methods with full-mechanized methods. The mechanization of the extraction operations is time consuming process and it requires high investment costs. So, cause special sensitivity in all design and implementation phases. Therefore, it is important to design, investigate and identify the capability of mechanization of coal layers in the first stage. For this purpose, the engineering capabilities of the coal layers of different mines should be analyzed that is important and necessary to achieve the above goals. Therefore, criteria affecting the mechanization of coal layers were identified. Then, 17 Stopes were studied that located in the Eastern Alborz Basin and Tabas mine. The combined used method to evaluate mechanization capability is combination method of Fuzzy set theory and FDAHP. The results of the fuzzy classification system presented in current study show that the T layer of Tabas has a good quality, the K11 layer of the Takht mine is located in the middle class and other layers have not qualify for mechanization properly. In the following, the results of this study were validated with current mining conditions. The results of the study showed that the multifactorial fuzzy classification system can reliably use to classify the mechanization of coal layers based on geological conditions.</abstract>

			<abstract>Soil electrical resistivity is an easy indicator of soil corrosion potential assessment. In order to investigate the soil corrosion in an industrial zone on the margin of the Meyghan salt lake (Kheyr-Abad industrial town), the electrical resistivity was measured by Miller box in laboratory considering different conditions in terms of moisture content. Soils in the region are generally fine-grained and typically are from clay type (CL/CH) according to USCS. In the minimum considered moisture content for the test, which correspond to the dry season, the soils of the study area have the moderate to the severe corrosive potential that increases to the Meyghan lake side. The corrosion potential pattern in superficial soils (0 to 5 m) follows northeastern to southwest waterway channels and is more homogeneous in the deeper parts (5 to 10 m). With increasing moisture content, the electrical resistivity is strongly reduced and in the moisture content of 25%, the corrosion potential of the soils of the study area increases to severe and very severe. Analysis of covariance and correlation coefficient of resistivity decreasing ratio due to increased moisture content with the basic physical properties of soil indicates that the fine grained material content (passing #200) has the most effect on the decreasing of resistivity. The plasticity index, liquid limit and dry density have minor effects in comparison to fine grained material content.</abstract>

			<abstract>Different methods for seismic zonation and building vulnerability sassessment are produced in different parts of the world. In these studies, seismic zonation is generally based on the geotechnical profile of the soil and the shear wave velocity. In 2013, Karmania hazard model (KHM) was presented to Iran, in which seismic zonation and vulnerability assessment of buildings and individuals in the worst earthquake scenarios are based on the basic parameters of the site, such as soil texture, groundwater level, microteremore data, and alluvial depth. In this study analytic hierarchy process (AHP (is applied in KHM model for seismic zonation and building vulnerability assessment of Kermanshah city. The results show that the vulnerability level for 80% of residential buildings would be low to moderate, but 2% of buildings would suffer from complete destruction (D1), 7% with very high destruction (D2) and 11% with high destruction (D3). Finally, the model is verified with the help of the data and observations from the Sarpol Zahab earthquake, which shows that the model is in good agreement with the actual earthquake data.</abstract>

			<abstract>In the present research, modeling of magnetic, resistivity (Rs) and induced polarization (IP) data ‎of Saveh North-Narbaghi deposit has been carried out. Also 23 deep boreholes with a total ‎depth of 2425m have been drilled scattered at the studied area. In the first step, processing ‎sequences were applied for magnetic data to highlight the deep anomalies using the Oasis ‎montaj. Afterward, inverse modeling of the geoelectric profiles were done using Res2dinv and ‎the optimum location of drilling was proposed on the basis of qualitative interpretation of ‎geophysical real sections containing chargeability, resistivity and metal factor (MF). In the ‎following the depth variations map of geoelectric properties was plotted and interpreted for ‎inverted data in four depths of 10, 25, 43 and 78 meters. Afterward, to imagine the spatial ‎variations of the electrical properties of the region and proposing the most appropriate location ‎for drilling operation, the quasi three-dimensional solid model of Rs, IP and MF variations of the ‎deposit after the smoothness inversion was mapped using Rockworks. Plotting ore deposit cross-‎section along the geophysical profiles using the assay data from the boreholes, revealed that ‎drilling of some boreholes located on the profiles and independent of the results of geophysical ‎operation, has been carried out without any right logic, purpose and design with no ore body. ‎Also the qualitative accordance of the results of geoelectrical operations with the assay data ‎from boreholes having ore body, located on the geophysical profiles, showed in general a ‎moderate qualitative accordance between these data.‎</abstract>

			<abstract>Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role of the principles of the theory of land ethics in monitoring the environmental impacts of civil projects. The present study is a field study. The research community includes all human communities, water resources and ecosystems (vegetation, animals, etc.) within the boundaries of the ghomroud tunnel project site. The data was collected using a field observations method and a series of field visits of site design (Geological survey in the city of Aligoudarz). Data analysis has been done with the help of descriptive statistics that have been interpreted in terms of land&#039;s theory of ethics. The results of the studies indicate that the ghomroud tunnel drilling operations, to changed the hydrology regime (the reduction dubai of springs and wells), migrating villagers , Weakening of agriculture and the local economy network, Impact on the habitat of plant-animal species, the impact on the region&#039;s image (the potential of the geotourism industry) led. Hydrogeological regime change in the region and social consequences, was related by geological conditions during drilling (existence of crushed zones, folding, slope of layers, lithological changes, etc.) in site design (Geological Zone of Sanandaj, Sirjan). Other implications of the project are also indirectly related to the geological conditions of the region.According to the results, it can be said that thinking of preventive measures to control the environmental consequences of such a project depends directly on the way of thinking and ethical planning of planners (relative to the environment).</abstract>
