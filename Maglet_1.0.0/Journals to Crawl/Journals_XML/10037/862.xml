						<title>Investigation of optimum depth for tunnel of Mashhad metro line 2</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=381&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>With respect to development of underground structures and their high construction costs in intra- and inter-municipal transportation, it is necessary to study the stability of such structures. In this research, tunnel stability of Mashhad Metro line 2 with 17 km length is studied. First, the type of sediments and geotechnical properties in Mashhad Plain are investigated. The SPT profiles were prepared using Rock Work 2006 software. The soil classification tests and XRD results show that the soils in this line are mostly clay such as Illite and Kaolinite types. Afterwards, because most of the soils in this line are characterized as fine grained, the ground settlement using PLAXIS V8 software was performed. According to the numerical modeling and the depth of tunnel, the optimum depth for tunnel was determined.</description>

						<title>Determination of Uniaxial Compressive Strength of Microcrystalline Limestone Using Single Particle Test</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=395&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Determination of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of intact rock is an important mechanical parameter required for many engineering projects. In some engineering projects, for example, well drilling has been accomplished for petroleum. The requirement of deep well to take samples to obtain rock core sample for determination of UCS is a difficult task. On the other hand, determination of this parameter is essential in order to analyze well wall stability and well development program. Therefore, the idea of using drilling cuttings is proposed for determination of UCS. In this paper, in order to develop relationship between UCS and single compressive strength (SCS) 7 block sample of microcrystalline limestone from Asmari formation were used. Then UCS test was performed and uniaxial compressive strength was determined. Next, these samples were crushed and 420 single particles were prepared. Then SCS for each particle was determined. Since the shape of particles affects particle strength, shape of particles was modified.  The total particles used for determination of SCS were spherical. In order to study the effect size of particle, particles with diameters 2, 3 and 4 millimeters were prepared and the SCS for each particle has been determined. With the increase of diameter of particles, the SCS has been increased too. In order to eliminate the effect of size of particles, it is defined variable size and strength and proposed chart between them. Coefficient of correlation between SCS and UCS is more than 0.91 which indicates a high correlation between them.</description>

						<title>The effect of pH of water and mineralogical properties on the slake durability of tuff in north Qazvin</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=380&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Slake durability of rocks is an important engineering parameter for evaluating deterioration of rocks in chemical and physical agents that are related to mechanical properties of rock. The main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the number of drying and wetting cycles under variable pH conditions and controls of mineralogical composition on durability. For this purpose, five different types of tuff were selected from different parts in north Qazvin city. The samples were subjected to multiple-cycle slake durability testing with different pH values solution. Also the slake durability tests in saturated condition on samples, petrographical analyses and basic physical - mechanical test were performed. In addition, to assess the influence of mineralogical composition on durability, the mineral contents of the original material and the material passing from the drum of the slake durability apparatus after fifteen cycles were also determined by XRD analyses. It was concluded that the slake durability of tuff is independent of the pH in acidic solution circumstances. Mineralogical composition, fabric and weathering rate are considered to have a greater influence on the slake durability of tuff. A strong relationship between the point load strength and the fifteenth-cycle slake durability index is found in the rock types studied.</description>

						<title>Statistical Prediction of Probabilistic Earthquake Hazard Zonation whit Artificial Neural Networks</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=382&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Prediction of location of future earthquakes with event probability is useful in reduction of earthquake hazard. Determination of predicted locations has attracted more attention to design, seismic rehabilitation and reliability of structures in these sites. Many theories were proposed in the prediction of time of occurrence of earthquake. There is not a method for prediction time of future earthquakes. Many studies have been done in the prediction of magnitude of earthquakes, but there are not any investigations on prediction of earthquake hazard zonation. In this study, the locations that have probability of the event of future earthquake have been predicted by artificial neural networks in Qum and Semnan. Neural networks used in this study can extract to complicate properties of patterns by receipting the interval patterns. Furthermore, the map of earthquake hazard zonation has been drawn. Properties of occurred earthquake were collected since 1903. The most probable event of earthquake in Qum has been predicted 31.6% in center, and 28.9% in north of Semnan</description>

						<title>Evaluation and comparison of Three Infiltration Methods in the Tow Catchment Area of in boshehr state by Use Double Ring Tests</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=384&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>The Water infiltration rate of a catchment area depends on a number of parameters. Each catchment area has its own peculiar infiltration features, depending on its climate and soil structure This research is a study and comparison of the banks of two permanent rivers of Bushehr Province (Iran), namely, the Mond and the Bahoosh, in the County of Tangestan. In order to determine and check the best penetration model and to calculate the infiltration coefficients of the Kostyakov-Lowese, SCS, and Philip models, the vertical water penetration rate of the soil was measured using field Double Ring tests (repeated for three times) in 60 test pits. Using computing software, the infiltration and aggregate infiltration rates’ curves were drawn and a Visual Basic software program was used for each model to specify the best coefficients, that is, those with the highest correlation with the curves. Results show that, for the Bahoosh riversides, the American SCS infiltration model has less errors than the Philip and Kostyakov-Lowese models, and for the Mond riversides, the Philip model is better than the Kostyakov-Lowese and American SCS models.</description>
