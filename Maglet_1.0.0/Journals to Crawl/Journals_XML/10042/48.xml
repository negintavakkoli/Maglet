						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=1072&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;Abstract: The urban network is a collection of large and small cities, each of which, in terms of size and performance, affects the evolutionary process of the area. This study uses the two concepts of competitiveness and urban network to investigate the effective factors in the occurrence and intensification of inequalities in the urban network of Esfahan. In this regard, the changes and transformations of Esfahan urban network during three periods of 1375, 1385 and 1395 with regard to competitiveness indices and considering the distance between cities (based on flow analysis method) and creation of competitiveness matrix, using urban network mapping In the social network analysis (Gephi) software is measured. In this way, for each concept at any given time, a separate network is plotted and analyzed. The results indicate that in the mentioned periods distribution of competitive ability as a stream of capital, labor, and information in the city-region of Esfahan has been unfair. As far as the metropolis of Esfahan with much difference, the gap in the urban hierarchy of city-regions Based on the concept of competitiveness. The second place in comparison with this view belongs to Najafabad and the third place belongs to Falavarjan. In addition, except for a few exceptions, the process of changing cities' competitiveness has been consistent with the process of changing the hierarchy of cities in the same time frame. Therefore, it can be said that the urban hierarchy pattern in the Esfahan urban network follows a competitive ranking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

						<title>Investigating the Possibility of Using Waqf and Interest-Free Bonds to Finance Public Spaces in the Surrounding Texture of Holy Shrine of Imam Reza</title>
						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=1073&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;Abstract: One of the most important and vital tissues in the country is the context around the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza. The main problem about this context is the lack of funding for public spaces. In the present study, the willingness of people to participate in the improvement of the worn out texture surrounding the Shrine of Imam Reza is estimated by purchasing waqf bonds and interest-free bonds, using the conditional valuation method. For this purpose, 240 pilgrims and adjacent persons were interviewed. In order to distinguish the factors influencing the decision on participation and the level of participation, two-stage method of Heckman and Tobit model were used. By eliminating incomplete answers, 57% of the people were willing to buy waqf bonds and, 48% of the people were willing to buy interest-free bonds. The results of the Hackit Model showed that the variables of &amp;ldquo;trust in local institutions&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;social awareness&amp;rdquo; influence significantly on respondents&amp;rsquo; decision to buy bonds. In addition, the &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging to the city&amp;rdquo; affects the degree of willingness to participate. In the case of interest-free bonds, the variable of social awareness has a significant effect on the decision of the respondents to participate in it. The variables of sense of belonging to the city and the neighborhood and the household&amp;rsquo;s economic situation have an impact on the degree of willingness to participate. While the belief in interest-free bonds and the variables of trust in local institutions, both in the first stage (decision to pay) and in the second stage (willingness to pay), have a significant effect on respondents. The average willingness to participate was estimated at 7,450,000 Rials for interest-free bonds and it was 1,660,000 for waqf bonds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Today, sustainable development policy is a public approach that governments have been considering to make ecologically sustainable tourism a promising local community in the long run. In this regard, the present study was conducted with the aim of planning sustainable development in the city of Ardebil. The research method is a descriptive-analytic type with an applied purpose. The data used in the research is documentary and field research. In order to achieve the most urgent and deterrent forces in the development of sustainable urban tourism, through the completion of a questionnaire and interview with 40 experts from urban tourism, effective strategies encouraging and inhibiting the development of sustainable tourism were formulated. Then, they were weighed and prioritized, using the network analysis (ANP) model. Finally, based on the most important adversary and deterrent forces, the most sustainable strategies for sustainable tourism development in Ardebil were extracted. The results of the research show that among the forces that encourage sustainable development of the city (creation of employment) the highest priority and among the inhibitory forces of sustainable development of the city (lack of sustainable management in the urban tourism sector) have the highest priority. Seven strategies were also identified and developed for the most important adversary and deterrent forces of city tourism development. Among the strategies proposed, the strategy (optimal and targeted utilization of increased incentives for travel among people to exploit the attractions and products of tourism in order to create employment and income for the people of Ardabil city) was selected as the best strategy. Moreover, in this research, the spatial pattern of the elemental inhabitants of Ardabil city was examined using the geographic information system (GIS) and it was determined that the tourism space of Ardabil city is influenced by the historical space of the city (old texture) and covers the central part of the city (area 1).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

						<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;Abstract: Smart citizenship component has been forgotten in the light of the theory of smart growth and urban excellence. In this theory, most urban planners and planners only study the indicators of the economy and exceptional services in cities, and the lifestyle and culture of citizens and its impact. They are less concerned with urban development. In this regard, in this research, Yazd city has been selected as the study to evaluate the indicators of smart citizens and its components in urban development and excellence. A survey from a sample of citizens, appropriate data was collected through a multi-criteria questionnaire with desirable validity and reliability. Using SPSS software, exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the validity and reliability of independent and dependent variables and then the named components were named. In the next step, using the confirmatory factor analysis in AMOS software, the validity of the research structures was tested. The statistical relation between the variables and their indices was confirmed. In the final model, using the fittest tests, the relationships between the variables and the effect of independent and dependent variables were confirmed. Findings of the research indicate that the significance of the law-governed factor is 31.579 percent of the variance explained more than other factors and citizens consider the role of law-governed in the characteristics of the smart citizen more critical. From the perspective of citizens, the optimal use of information and communication technology and the formation of the smart city have a positive effect on the various economic, social, and environmental dimensions of Yazd city. So while recognizing the need for training with new ways and content, they see the role of ICT in better life experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=1077&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;Abstract: The housing market is one of the most important subsectors of capital markets that have the most backward and forward linkages with other sectors. Because of the high dependence of Iranian economy to oil revenues, oil price shocks can be affect the housing market. The aim of this study is to analyze the business cycle of the housing market, with emphasis on the impact of oil shocks on the return of housing. According to APM model, regardless of portfolio selected, several factors affect the return of housing assets that in this study, the risk and shocks of macroeconomic factors including money supply, private sector investment, housing facilities allocated by special Maskan Bank and oil export revenues, have been analyzed on the housing return by a Markov regime-switching GARCH model during the period 1982 -2016. The results have shown that the return of housing in the Iranian economy has three high, moderate and low return regimes. So that the volatility of the housing return is different in each of the three regimes. Housing returns volatility at the low return regime is more than volatility of returns at the moderate and high return regimes. Therewith in the 35 years of the research period, housing market has been 13 years in the moderate return regime, 20 years in the low return regime and only 2 years in the high return regime. The results also showed that based on Dutch disease hypothesis oil shocks, liquidity and private investment have a significant positive impact on the return of housing but the housing facilities of Maskan Bank have a significant negative impact on the return of housing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

						<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;Abstract: Employment and the achievement of people in the desired job are considered as one of the most basic needs of the society, and the elimination of unemployment as a social, economic and cultural destructive phenomenon is one of the most important concerns of policy makers and planners in different countries. In addition it is and one of the main indicators of development of societies. In most countries, the solution to achieve this is through the provision of the infrastructure needed to set up and run small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the importance of small and medium enterprises in the process of economic and social development of countries and the special attention of planners and development policymakers to this important issue, policy makers need to adopt a policy suitable for the growth and development of small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the policy-making of the aforementioned businesses, from a theoretical perspective, requires an accurate basis to help create an entrepreneurial economy with more entrepreneurs and achieve the goals set by the country. Accordingly, this research aims at designing a policy framework for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, with an emphasis on innovation and making use of domestic and international knowledge and experience to improve the policy process of small and medium-sized enterprises development and its numerous valuable results, especially in terms of employment assistance and unemployment reduction. In this paper, an attempt has been made to construct a proper framework for conducting research based on previous research and documentary studies. Then, based on the initial framework, a deep study and a case study were analyzed using the interviewing tool and study documents to extract the conceptual model. To analyze the extracted data from interviews, open source and axial coding was used. Finally, the resulting pattern in four dimensions was drawn from the effective factors on business development, development policies, policy-making bodies, and the performance of small and medium businesses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
