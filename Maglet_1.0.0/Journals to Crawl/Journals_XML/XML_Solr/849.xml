One of the good strategies for good urban governance is the development of sustainable tourism in order to achieve sustainable urban incomes. Tourism as the second industry plays an important role in the cycle of economic activity, employment development, currency and tax revenue, and compensation for the lack of credit for other sectors of the economy in small and medium-sized cities. The purpose of this research is to analyze the role of good urban governance in promoting sustainable urban tourism through tourism in Masjed Soleyman city. The method of this research is mixed-exploratory and according to the data, it is quantitative and qualitative research and data access method is documentary and survey. The population of the sample is 30 urban experts and the sampling method is selective and targeted. In order to analyze the data, inferential statistics (sample t-test) was used in SPSS software and also for weighting the variables considered by multi-criteria decision-making models ANP and Super Decision software were used. The findings indicate that among the good urban governance variables that have an impact on sustainable urban incomes, the indicators for equipping the infrastructure, and facilities for attracting private investment in tourism is the most important and the index of equality of all shareholders against the benefits and plans of tourism development, has taken the lowest weight. The analytical results of the study of good urban governance variables that could be effective in increasing sustainable urban tourism through tourism have not been considered. The reasons for this unsatisfactory state of tourism infrastructure are inadequate facilities for attracting private sector investment (with a score of 0.12), lack of incentives for private sector investors in tourism (0.98), weakness in integrated urban management, including tourism development policies and lack of sufficient supervision over the performance of urban management and local institutions (0.016).</field></doc></add>
