						<title>Comparison the Different Methods of Seismic Response Analysis in Liquefiable sites against Near and Far-Field Earthquakes</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2276&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;Due to the increasing importance of geomorphologic conditions on the seismic ground response, the effect of liquefiable soils on seismic ground surface response is discussed. At first, the equivalent linear analysis based on total stress model in the frequency domain is carried out and then the nonlinear analyses based on total stress, effective stress model and considering the pore water pressure development in time domain are done in order to evaluate the differences between the several types of ground response analysis methods. DEEPSOIL.Ver5 software is used based on the latest achievements and various techniques in both solution domains. LNG port project in Assaluyeh, situated in south of Iran, is considered as a case study. Due to lack of the real data recorded near-field fault at the project site, the simulated method is used in order to create the artificial earthquake. Also three far-field earthquakes have been selected based on conventional seismic hazard studies for the seismic ground response analysis. Then, in order to better understanding of the obtained responses, the resulted responses spectra are compared with the acceleration design spectra provided in some valid codes. The result of this study indicates that the pulse effect in the horizontal component of acceleration perpendicular to the fault plane direction, affects severely the surface ground response of the near-field earthquake. The obtained results of the nonlinear modeling of the soil with excess pore water pressure build-up in the time-domain are extremely different from those of frequency-domain responses based on the equivalent linear method. In addition, because of the inherent linearity of equivalent linear analysis which can lead to spurious resonances in ground responses, the peak ground acceleration in the time-domain is lower than the frequency-domain&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Flow analysis of the Rozieh water conveyance tunnel during the construction and operation phase using numerical simulation</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2329&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;Because most part of Iran country is located in a dry climate, construction of water conveyance tunnels is inevitable. One of the major challenges in the construction of these tunnels is inflow of water into the tunnel during the construction and operation phase. The Rozieh water conveyance tunnel whose length is 3200 meters is a part of water conveyance project to the Semnan city and it is located 30 k NE of Semnan city. In accordance with the drilled boreholes, the tunnel route has been classified into eight zones from the geotechnical view. Then the permeability coefficients of host rock were calculated using back analysis approach on the basis of numerical simulation results and water inflow quantity during the construction phase. A parametric study was done on the lining and cement injection zone permeability and the thickness of cement injection zone. According to this study, the effect of injection zone thickness variation on the water inflow quantity is negligible. So with the assumption of 3 meters thickness for the injection zone, the permeability coefficient of host rock after injection were evaluated. Dependent on the initial rock permeability, cement injection could reduce the rock permeability 10 to 1000 times. In addition, the water inflow into the tunnel was calculated using hydro-mechanical coupling analysis. According to this analysis, the water inflow calculated by the hydro-mechanical coupling analysis is 50 to 70 percent less than the hydraulic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Investigation of position marlston in rock mass enginnering classification system,case study: Doosti Dam</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2325&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;Marly rocks of Abtalkh formation were classified by Q, RMR, RSR and RQD rock mass classification systems using 222 meters logs from exploratory boreholes in Doosti dam site. The results show that the RMR is the most suitable method for classification of studied rock masses and has highest correlation coefficient with RQD. The validity of different Q-RMR equations was studied using error ratio (ER). Cameron et al. (1981) and Morno (1982) equations have lowest ER and highest validity for studied marlstones. Bieniawski (1989) and Cameron (1981) relationships are lower and higher limits of equations for marly rocks respectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Assessing Environmental Risk Caused by Zanjan’s Paverood Dam in its Construction Stage Using a combination of TOPSIS and RAM-D Methods</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2328&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Objective of the present research is to identify, analyze, and assess risk of Paveroud Dam during construction phase. Following collection and analysis of the information related to environmental conditions of the area of study and technical specifications of dam construction, a list of probable risk factors was prepared in the form of a questionnaire, and for verification, the questionnaires were provided to a group of specialists consisting of elites and professors specialized at the disciplines relevant to environment and civil engineering. Number of questionnaires was determined based on Cochran&amp;rsquo;s formula. In the first step, the expert group in the research was asked to score in Likert scale format so as to analyze the acquired responses and the risks present in the region. Having analyzed the scores using the findings of PHA method, TOPSIS technique was applied to prioritize the identified risks of Paveroud Dam. The results indicated that erosion had the highest priority among 36 risk factors. After prioritization among the risk factors, risk was also assessed using RAM-D technique in which &amp;ldquo;impact on Sorkhabad Protected Zone with 9 scores, &amp;ldquo;erosion&amp;rdquo; with 6 scores, and &amp;ldquo;work at high elevation&amp;rdquo; with 3 scores were recognized as three major risks of Paveroud Dam. In order to mitigate the effects of dam risks during construction phase, environmental management planning is crucial, and for this purpose, risk mitigation choices were recommended at the end aimed at coping with the identified risks.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Sedimentology of fluvial deposits composition of Sharbyan River as raw material for hot asphalt and its optimization using hydrated lime</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2291&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;direction: ltr; text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;The Sharbyan river is located in the Sharbyan village, Sarab, East Azarbaijan province. This river alluvials are supplied from rock units belonging to Oligo-miocene and Miocene, including conglomerate, sandy lime, limestone, marl and shale. These deposits are used as raw materials of producing hot asphalt in two asphalt plants that have been built in the vicinity of this river, and the produced asphalt is used mainly in the neighbor provinces that have rather cold climate. Combined analysis of the sediments indicate high level of silica, around 60 percent, for which&amp;nbsp; the prepared asphalt&amp;nbsp; is prone to stripping phenomenon in the cold seasons. During this process, the moisture penetration in aggregates and asphalt mixtures, causes weakening bitumen-asphalt materials bounding and finally asphalt demolition.&amp;nbsp; The role of sediments and its impact on the quality of asphalt has not been studied in this area, therefore, the solutions for dealing with this phenomenon is also examined and presented. This study is based on the conventional sedimentology methods, different standards of ASTM&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;AASHTO and Ministry of Roads and Urban Development guidelines. In this study, the combined effects of hydrated lime (lime filler) and natural filter materials with different proportions was used to deal with the stripping phenomenon, and&amp;nbsp; the parameters of strength, softness, indirect tensile strength, asphalt quality and durability criteria, have been appraised. The results show that these parameters are improved using additives in various proportions and the produced asphalt quality and durability is better. The results illustrate, when the lime is used in its maximum ratio of 3%, stripping score is 1 and is disappeared by other parameters improvement&lt;/p&gt;

						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2327&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;direction: ltr; text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;This paper presents landslide assessment and landslide hazard zonation of the Polroud Dam area.&lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK9&quot;&gt; Polroud Dam is one of the largest dams that are in construction, 29 km south of Roudsar in &lt;/a&gt;Gilan Province. Considering to geomorphology and geological conditions of the area, the site is susceptible to landslide hazard. &lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK1&quot;&gt;Field survey shows many evidences of the instabilities especially in the slopes overlooking to the dam and the reservoir.&lt;/a&gt; The historical record also demonstrates high potential of the region to slope instabilities. A large landslide that occurred in 1996 discern that the frequency of the hazard in the region. Therefore, Identification of the landslide potential hazard is vital before impounding the reservoir. &lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK27&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;OLE_LINK26&quot;&gt;In this study, we investigated landslide hazard in the site and we have prepared landslide hazard zonation map using the main parameters. These parameters include; slope percent, slope aspect, lithology, fault, roads, drainage catchment, elevation, vegetation and precipitation amount.&lt;/a&gt; Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) has been used to prepare and to cross the maps. The results show that about 26 percent of the slopes are situated in highly hazard zones. It was determined also that lithology and slope aspects play main role in occurring of the landslides in the study area.&lt;br&gt;

						<title>Experimental Investigation of Bank Angle and Grain Size ِDistribution Effects on Seepage Erosion of River Banks</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2197&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;Subsurface flow contributes considerably to river flow and plays an important role in river sediment loads. This research has been focused on investigation of soil properties and bankstream slope on seepage erosion&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; For this purpose a series of lysimeter experiments were performed for four different slopes of bankstream by varying the soil grain sizes. The obtained results indicate that Reynolds number in porous medium plays an effective role in depth of scour hole in noncohesive layer. It was observed that the time of beginning of sediment motion decreases with an increase in the soil grain size.&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Optimum Design of Soil Nailed Walls Based on Deformation Criterion under Seismic Loads</title>
						<link>http://jeg.khu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2561&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; &quot;&gt;Soil nailing is a prevalent method for temporary or permanent stabilization of excavations which, if it is used for permanent purposes, the seismic study of these structures is important. There are a few physical models, with limited information available, for the study of behavior of soil nailed walls under earthquake loading. Numerical methods may be used for the study of effects of various parameters on the performance of soil nailed walls, and this technique has been used in the current paper. In this research, the effects of various parameters such as the spacing, configuration, and lengths of nails, and the height of wall on seismic displacement of soil nailed walls under the various earthquake excitations were studied. To investigate the effects of the configuration and the lengths of nails on the performance of these structures, two configurations of uniform and variable lengths of nails have been used. To study the effects of the spacing between nails and the height of the wall the spacings of 2 and 1.5 meters and the heights of 14, 20, and 26 meters have been considered. The seismic analysis has been carried out using the finite element software Plaxis 2D. To analyze the lengths' of nails, it was assumed that the safety factors of stability of different models are constant, and the limit equili&lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;brium software GeoSlope was used. After specification of the lengths of nails based on constant safety factor of stability, the deformations of the models under several earthquakes records were analyzed, and recommendations were made on minimizing the deformations of soil nailed walls under seismic loading.&lt;/p&gt;
