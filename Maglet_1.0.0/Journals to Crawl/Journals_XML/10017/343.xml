			<abstract>Learning is taken as a competitive advantage of organizations to win over their rivals, and learner organization is the one which takes the advantages of continuous learning of all its staff members in order to create, share and apply knowledge so that it can suitably react to the environmental changes. Authorities characterize a learner organization as follows: personal capacities intellectual models, joint perspective, team-based learning, a disciplined thinking, leadership, organization culture and knowledge structure and management each of which is measurable based on a set of criteria
Generally this study aims at proposing an appropriate model for the establishment of learner organization in the Army of the I.R. of Iran. As an applied and case study, it first offers the nine-fold criteria of identifying learner organization along with the scales of each criterion. Then, the professors offering courses in the Army universities were questioned as to verifying the criteria. Subsequently the Army units were evaluated based on these validated criteria. The findings sustain that the Army can be considered as a learning organization and the affiliated units are characterized by the highest percentage of learner organization in terms of the following criteria: leadership, disciplined thinking, organizational culture, personal capacity, intellectual model, team-based learning, Joint perspective, and knowledge structure and management.</abstract>

			<abstract>The purpose of this study was to distinguish and define psychometrically different factors and underling motives contributing to competition. 400 Subjects, male and female high school students (aged 14-18), were randomly selected. Franken’s Competitive Mastery Questionnaire was administered to two groups. Factor analysis of separate male and female data using Principal Components Analysis with Varimax and Oblimin rotations resulted in extraction of seven factors with an eigen value greater than 1 for males and six factors for females. Two factors named &quot;desire to win&quot; and &quot;motivation to put forth effort in competitive situations&quot; are more common in both groups. However the latter was significantly correlated with academic achievement; but no significant correlation existed between academic achievement and the former one. Another factor named &quot;satisfaction resulting from performing well&quot; loaded more on males, and two other factors named &quot;preference for difficult tasks&quot; and &quot;satisfaction resulting from improving one’s performance&quot; enjoyed higher loadings with females. Thus, it is concluded that males and females are similar in some of the competitiveness factors but different in some others. Generally speaking, results of this study confirm the previous researches in competitiveness factors.

			<abstract>This study aimed to investigate relationship between the mentioned variables. This study is an applied in purpose, survey in design and field study in terms of data collection procedure.
To conduct this study, shad’s emotional intelligence inventory was distributed among 32 commanders and 507 cadets selected based on stratified random sampling. The data was analyzed through SPSS thereby Pearson product correlational analysis and linear regression analysis were run. The findings revealed positive correction among the variables (r=0.58, r=0.31, and r=0.35) indicating significant at p&lt;0.5. Meanwhile, positive and significant correlation was explored between the evaluation parameters and emotional expression as well as between the regulation and management of emotion and tolerance of stress, self-esteem and accountability.
On the contrary, no significant correlation was revealed between exploiting emotion and the three other variables. The squared correlation rate (R2adj) for tolerance of stress, self-esteem, and accountability were 0.096, 0.071 and 0.32, respectively. It means that emotional intelligence parameters (i.e. evaluation, emotion expression, regulation and management of emotion and emotion exploitation) explain %10, %7 and %32 of the total variance of the dependent variables. The findings also showed positive relationship between EI of the company commanders with their cadet’s tolerance of stress and self-esteem (r=0.054 and r=0.008) respectively. However, the relationship between the commanders’ EI and the cadets’ accountability was negative (r=0.057), though non-significant statistically.</abstract>

			<abstract>Shahnameh is rich in terms of advice and wisdom. Without doubt, ethical, behavioral and performance characteristics (heroic behavior) are determining factors in the result of wars. Rational selection and appointment of commanders for various responsibilities play an important role in the promotion of organizational objectives or failure of commanders or managers. In the epic of Siavosh’s arrival, Firdausi cites certain evil and omen characteristics of the commanders and heroes. The characteristics arouse various reactions which determine the result of war and indicate relationship between them and military commands. As a descriptive and qualitative in nature, this study aimed to elaborate on ethical aspects of the hero’s personalities under various situations and their relation to commanders’ behavior and ethic. Having summed up the story, this study presents some of the examples extracted from one of the sample stories as management teaching points. </abstract>

			<abstract>Following the drastic developments at global levels and increase in the material and spiritual expenses of resorting to hard war, tendency to soft war, has gained momentum. In fact, one of the main factors contributing to authority and security and protecting and sustaining them is the extend to which the cadets (as the officers of soft war) possess the knowledge of the nature and various dimensions of hard war. Lack of the knowledge is hazardous in that it encourages the invasion of foreigners and enemies beliefs against the belief and thought system of our military forces.
To this end, this study as a &quot;descriptive-field&quot; study in nature, objectives and methodology, aims too investigate extent of the knowledge and perceptions of the cadets as to the nature and various dimensions of soft war. Both questionnaire and library resources were used. The findings reveal that the cadets enjoy a very good level of the knowledge and perception such that 60.6 percent of respondents are at the very highest level of awareness. Factors such as &quot;observation of Quranic and shiat Imams&#039; models&quot; &quot;belief in Velayat and binding to it&quot; giving insight and seeking for insight&quot; &quot;faith and ethic have had the highest frequency in struggling the enemy&#039;s soft war. Meanwhile, TV has produced the highest effect while library and exploiting written resources and information centers of the university have played the least effective role in raising knowledge and awareness.
In this regard, what is more expected from the cadets is that while sustaining and taking the advantages of the Islamic principles, Quran, following the holy prophet and innocent Imams and Obeying Velayat, as well as through improving their knowledge insight, faith and ethic in a bid to fight soft war and neutralize the enemy&#039;s efforts, they can always try and increase their knowledge and strength.</abstract>

				<title>Structure of international system and strategy of dealing with Iran and Zionist regime’s nuclear power</title>

			<abstract>International system is of the nature in which all states are seeking for increased power and no single state can do it and dominate over all states. Based on the logic governing the international system, great powers are the major players of the international plays; they compose the rules of the game, bring them to the sense, and then perform. The rules can be ignored if they are contrary to their national interests. Gist of the argument of the neo-realists is that access of small powers to nuke is dangerous, while the real threat is from those traditional powers which threaten the international system.
Then, the world is witness to double standards exerted by the great powers in dealing with the nuke activities of Iran and Zionist occupier regime. They prevent Iran from gaining access to peaceful nuke while equipping Zionist occupier regime with nuclear weapons. This strategy, being underway, is specially supported by the USA and participation of certain great powers. Focusing on this issue, the present study attempts to address this double-standard given the current nature of the international system. Accordingly, it is held that presently great powers do not look at the USA increasing power and its display as a challenge for their vital objectives rather they evaluate them based on norms and values which guarantee their interests.</abstract>
