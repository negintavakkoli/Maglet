title = {An Evaluation of Large-Scale Commercial Buildings Architectural Space Indicators with an Approach to Urban Threats and Risks}, 
abstract ={Abstract: Achieving to technical criteria that by applying them in architectural design stage of large commercial buildings, considered as one of the most important uses in urban planning, can increase the level of citizens&#8217; security against all kinds of natural hazards and threats, and reduce vulnerability and it can provide continuation of the services and activities of these buildings. The present study has a developmental-applied nature. By descriptive-survey method, the issue is investigated in large-scale commercial buildings. In this research, to assess the architectural space of large-scale commercial buildings, five criteria including continuity of activities in emergencies, costs, facilitating emergency exit, reducing the impact of explosions and earthquakes are considered. In this research, using Swara and Smart methods, the subject matter and the proposed model for evaluating the vulnerability of the architectural space are discussed. The results of the evaluation of the criteria and indicators of the architectural space indicate that the criteria for reducing the effect of the explosion, facilitating emergency exit, the continuity of activities in crisis, earthquake and cost with the weights of 0.3056, 0.2778, 0.2315, 1852.0 and 0.1543 are ranked first to fifth. Using the proposed model, the architecture of large-scale commercial buildings can be evaluated against urban threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerability and weaknesses of these buildings in each indicator and criterion.},

title = {The Study of Determinants of Rent Housing in Ilam City Based on Hedonic Spatial Econometrics}, 
abstract ={Abstract: Housing unit is heterogeneous and multidimensional commodity; therefore, to determine effective factors on rent, hedonic pricing model is used. To explain the factors, four properties are used for housing, which are physical variables of residential units, access variables, environmental variables (neighborhood), and economic and social characteristics. The variables related to the spatial property are used by spatial hedonics to bind the lease function to the location. Spatial hedonic technique is able to determine the effective factors on the rental of housing, also the impact of renting housing from other properties of adjacent ones. In this paper, using linear, semi-logarithmic, logarithmic and box-cox models, the effect of each of the properties of leased residential units on their rental prices has been investigated using simple and spatial hedonic function. The results indicate that the best model is the linear model. Moreover, among the residential apartments in Ilam, physical and socioeconomic factors affect the rental of residential units more than neighborhoods and access variables, as well as the effect of spatial dependent variable in spatial hedonic model on rentals is quite significant and positive. The estimated model of spatial econometric method is well fitted; the percentage of coefficients and the explanation of the effect of the variables in the model are more efficient and better than conventional econometric methods.},

title = {Optimization of Urban Budget Allocation Based on Spatial Justice Indicators (Case: Mashhad Metropolis)}, 
abstract ={Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of urban managers is to create justice in the area of fair and equal access of citizens to urban services. By objective realization of spatial justice concept, while providing the citizens with the appropriate services, the ground of reducing urban problems is prepared. Spatial justice is one of the main concepts of sustainable urban development. This can be achieved by making the right decision about the allocation of the city budget. Recognizing prosperous and non-prosperous areas fair and informed allocation of financial resources among urban areas require the use of a technique that takes into account different and sometimes conflicting criteria for decision making. In this research, using PROMETHEE V-C technique, it has been tried to examine Mashhad metropolitan financial resources to thirteen areas, taking into account the criteria of spatial justice, in the form of a case study. The results indicate that the holy city of Mashhad is not in desirable position in terms of spatial justice indicators. Samen area is recognized as the most prosperous and district 3 as the most deprived area in the city of Mashhad. The high ability of the proposed technique to allocate budget equitably with multiple indicators has been shown in this study; therefore, this technique can be used as an effective tool for urban decision-making.},

title = {An Analysis of Urban Sprawl Using Factor Analysis Technique (Case: Qazvin City Districts)}, 
abstract ={Abstract: Urban sprawl is an issue in many cities throughout the world, which has affected many aspects of urban life negatively. Urban sprawl, which is generally attributed to horizontal and leapfrogged extension of city boundaries caused by citizen&#8217;s will to leave central urban areas and live in urban countryside. The first step for tackling this problem is the identification of sprawled places and the influential factors on sprawl in urban land. Therefore, this article analyses urban sprawl phenomenon in Qazvin city districts. Relying on relevant theoretical texts, 13 indicators are chosen among others in literature for measuring urban sprawl in Qazvin districts. These indices are localized according to the conditions of Iran and the data associated with each of them are extracted using census statistics and Geographic Information System (GIS). Then, factor analysis technique is implemented by SPSS software and the indicators are attributed to four factors. By assessing the contributing indicators to each factor, they are named density, configuration, land-use and accessibility respectively. The results of factor analysis are very consistent with literature. These factors explain the variance of urban sprawl by 27.8, 21.6, 11.3 and 9.5 percent respectively. It is shown that &#34;shape index&#34; and &#34;fractal dimension&#34; as new indicators for measuring urban sprawl are significantly effective on this phenomenon. Results show that districts 4, 5, 7, 11 and 12 are the most sprawled and districts 17, 28, 38 and 39 are the least sprawled districts in Qazvin. These two new indexes in Iranian urban literature can be used in other sprawl studies in the country. In addition, the results of this study can guide Qazvin municipality to make important decisions about the direction of city development.},

title = {On-Grid Simulation of Distributed Generation (DG) of Renewable Electricity in Urban Lighting in the Context of Sustainable Urban Management (Case: Mashhad)}, 
abstract ={Abstract: Lighting passages is done for citizens&#8217; welfare simultaneously with the peak of the consumption of the network, from sunset to sunrise. The present study aimed at designing a model of sustainable urban management in the field of lighting, with simulation of the use of photovoltaic LEDs instead of sodium and halogen lamps. Accordingly, in a system simulation of the network, the scenarios for adjusting the input of various photovoltaic capacities to the electricity supply system of the city of Mashhad have been investigated. The results of on-grid analysis by using this decentralized production pattern shows, taking into account the 200 watts capacity and the 20% utilization factor for each photovoltaic LEDs and installing a photovoltaic LED instead of sodium and halogen lamps, all the power needed to lighting of city streets is provided by photovoltaic solar technology. Moreover, by reducing the potential between fossil and renewable production, emissions of pollutants are reduced by 104,000 tons. Therefore, this method can be used to manage clean and sustainable energy in urban scale consumption, and, while helping the environment and reducing air pollution, it prevents losses caused by the transfer of electrical energy from the plant to the place of consumption.},

title = {Designing a Model for Improving Business Environment in the City of Tehran}, 
abstract ={Abstract: Improving the environment in which businesses operate is important to business success. In particular, improving the environment reduces transaction costs and improves the competitiveness of businesses. The business environment of the city has unique characteristics that need to be understood and analyzed in various aspects. This research aims to design a model for improving the business environment in the city of Tehran using exploratory approach to identify the components and dimensions of the model. For this purpose, firstly explicit knowledge exists in the literature is reviewed and then a qualitative research methodology is employed to explore the implicit knowledge of experts obtained through interviews with 22 experts. After documenting the data obtained from the interviews, a three stage coding method is used to analyze&#160; the collected information and data using Atlas Ti. In the end, by combining the findings from the literature and the findings from the analysis of the interviews, a model is designed for improving the business environment in Tehran. It is worth noting that this model has identified and classified environment factors affecting the improvement of the business environment at the four levels of organizational, micro, macro, and international. Urban environment components include physical infrastructure, non-physical infrastructure, laws and regulations, institutions, local-participatory governance, policy for citizenship, institutional co-operation, urban-level competition development, private-public partnerships, organising businesses in the interior and exterior of the city, identification and development of opportunities, implication of new knowledge and technology, sustainable income for urban development, urban spatial development, transaction costs and tax support. The components of the micro-environment include suppliers, the labor market, credit market, the media and the customer. The components of the macroeconomic environment are demographic (immigration management), environmental, legal, political, technological, economic and social factors, and ultimately the components of the international environment include cultural, political, technological, and innovation components and law factors.},

title = {Economic and Environmental Factors Determining the Amount of Carbon Dioxide Emissions in the MENA Countries}, 
abstract ={Abstract: The gradual warming of the earth and its negative environmental and economic impacts contributed to pay attention to sustainable development considerably. Since climate change is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, countries are seeking to prevent the rapid growth of emissions to reduce global climate change. Accordingly, and considering the importance of the subject, the present study examines the effects of variables such as per capita income, population, energy consumption structure, energy intensity, degree of trade openness, industry share of GDP on carbon dioxide emissions in MENA countries, during 1993-2015 based on the regression model of population stochastic effects, Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STRIPAT) and Spatial Durbin Panel Data Model (SDPDM). The results of this study indicate that the logarithm of GDP, population, energy structure and energy intensity have a positive and significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions, and the degree of trade openness has a negative and significant effect on carbon emissions. In addition, the positive and significant effect of the intermittent spatial variable indicates that carbon emissions are highly relevant among different regions. In general, the results of model estimation show that attention is more important to spatial correlation, heterogeneity and external effects in policymaking.},
