		<Abstract>the professional training of student teachers at Farhangian University is of great importance; and one of the essential guides in this regard is their school internship experience. The purpose of this study was narrative research with the aim of analyzing and representing different aspects of student experience in school students with an interpretive approach. Episodic interviews were used to collect data. Research potential contributors were people who had completed their undergraduate degrees at Kurdistan University of Culture and had at least one semester of internship experience in schools. Purposeful sampling was done. After interviewing 30 people, the data were inductively classified and analyzed based on thematic analysis using Nvivo10 software. The analysis showed that the internship experience in schools resulted in the development of teaching and classroom skills for students. Narratives have shown that student teachers can develop professional and communication skills by utilizing their school internship experience; these include the communication and collaboration of students, teachers, teachers and administrators in school activities, as well as individual and independent learning and teaching activities during school internships. The experience of internships in schools as a bridge between university and school led to the application of knowledge in the field of practice to students. The findings recommend that, given the importance and impact of school internships for students, teachers should be given more detailed curriculum planning to prepare students for this process by the Ministry of Education and the decision making process. Engage and guide this process by people who are already trained and skilled in the field.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; the professional training of student teachers at Farhangian University is of great importance; and one of the essential guides in this regard is their school internship experience.

			<OtherAbstract Language="FA">پژوهش حاضر با رویکردی تفسیری و کیفی و با راهبرد روایت‎پژوهی انجام شد. هدف پژوهش تحلیل ابعاد مختلف رهبری مدرسه از طریق بازنمایی تجارب کارورزی مشارکت‎کنندگان در مدارس بود. به‌منظور جمع‎آوری داده‌ها از یک پروتکل مصاحبه‎‎ی واقعه‎گرا به شیوۀ نیمه‎ساختارمند استفاده شد. مشارکت‌کنندگان بالقوۀ‌ این پژوهش مشارکت‎کنندگان و فارغ‌التحصیلان رشته‌های دبیری و علوم تربیتی از دانشگاه فرهنگیان کردستان و دانشگاه‎های دولتی، پیام نور و آزاد اسلامی واقع در شهر سنندج بودند که تجربه‌ی گذراندن حداقل یک ترم دوره‌ی کارورزی را در طول تحصیل خود داشتند نمونه‎گیری به‌صورت هدفمند و ملاکی انجام شد. پس از مصاحبه با 30 نفر داده‎ها به شکل استقرایی و بر اساس تحلیل مضمونی با استفاده از نرم‎افزار Nvivo10 دسته‌بندی و مورد تحلیل قرار گرفت. تحلیل‎ها نشان داد که تجربه کارورزی در مدارس علاوه بر توسعه‌ی مهارت‎های تدریس و مدیریت کلاس دیدگاهی نو دربارۀ مدیریت و رهبری مدرسه را برای دانشجویان در پی داشت. همچنین مشارکت‎کنندگان به رشد مهارت‎های حرفه‎ای معلمی و ارتباطات انسانی دست پیدا کردند و ارتباط و همکاری مشارکت‎کنندگان با یکدیگر، با معلمان و مدیران در فعالیت‎های مدرسه­ای و هم‎چنین انجام فعالیت‎های یادگیری، توسعۀ حرفه‎ای و تلاش برای توسعۀ مهارت‎های رهبری در مدارس از این جمله‎اند. توصیه می‌شود که با توجه به تأثیرگذاری کارورزی در مدارس برای آماده‎سازی رهبران آموزشی، برنامه‎ریزی دقیق‎تری ازلحاظ سرفصل‌های درسی از سوی وزارت آموزش‌وپرورش و دانشگاه‎ها انجام شود و جریان تصمیم‎گیری و هدایت این فرایند توسط افرادی که از قبل برای این کار آموزش لازم را دیده‎اند و متخصص و دارای رشته‎ی مرتبط هستند پیش برود. درنهایت مفهوم رهبری مدرسه حول هفت مضمون اصلی شامل مدیریت کلاس درس، خودبهسازی حرفه‌ای، تربیت‌معلم فکور، تربیت مدیر بینش­مند، تحمل محرک‌های فشارزا، یادگیری رهبری مدرسه و تربیت‌معلم پژوهنده توسط کارورزان بازنمایی شد.</OtherAbstract>
