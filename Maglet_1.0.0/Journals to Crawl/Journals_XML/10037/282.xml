abstract ={./files/site1/files/1Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages1-28) Introduction The earthquake is one of the most devastating natural disasters that always threats human societies in terms of health and financial issues. Iran is one of the most seismic prone countries of the world due to locating on Alpine- Himalayan Orogenic belt. On the other hand, growing population and increased construction of tall buildings, increases the damages caused by large earthquakes, especially in large cities. Karaj is one of the most populous cities in Iran which there has been considerable industrial and economic development in recent years. When an earthquake occurs, seismic waves radiate away from source and travel rapidly through the earth crust. When these waves reach the ground surface, they produce shaking that may last from several seconds to a few minutes. During earthquakes, different alluviums with different structures show various reactions. It is well-accepted that, besides the earthquake magnitude and fault distance, local geologic conditions, known as site effects, can also exert significant influences on characteristics of the seismic waves such as amplitude, frequency content and duration of strong ground motion at a given location. The seismic ground motion at any site is influenced by the type of soil in that region. Younger and softer soils usually amplify ground motion more than older soils or bedrocks . There are theoretical and experimental methods to evaluate the site response. In the present study, the Nakamura's H/V spectral ratio method has been used to evaluate the resonance frequency in 37 locations at Karaj site. In addition, a preliminary 1-D site response modelling has been conducted using Deepsoil program according to downhole, array and geology data. Site frequencies obtained from modelling are presented and compared with site frequencies obtained through microtremor measurements. Materials and Methods Single station microtremor measurements at the Karaj site were carried out by the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES) in 2012 with a three-component broadband seismometer (Guralp CMG-6TD). In the present study, we have used 37 microtremor data along the north-southwest profile because at this profile, geological section was available and these stations contained geotechnical boreholes data. Dynamic range of sensor changes between 0.033 -50 Hz and has a natural period of 1 second. 24-bit analog-to-digital (A/D) converter digitized the recorded data. The recording system was operated continuously for about 30 minutes with sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The use of ambient vibrations for analysis of the local site effects has been studied in detail in the framework of the European research project SESAME (Site Effects Assessment Using Ambient Excitations). The recommended guidelines on the H/V spectral ratio technique are the result of the comprehensive and detailed analysis performed by the SESAME participants during three years of investigations (2001-2004). H/V spectral ratio was carried out by the Geopsy software. The process starts by converting data from binary format to ASCII format. After DC offset removal, eighth order Butterworth band pass filter used within the range of 0.1 Hz to 50 Hz. The Anti-triggering algorithm STA/LTA has been selected to reject energetic transients from ambient vibration recordings, so STA and LTA were considered respectively 1 and 30 second. Minimum and maximum STA/LTA thresholds were selected between 0.2 and 2.5. For each station, the time-series of the record is divided into windows of 40 to 100 seconds in three components with an overlap of 50%. Also, a cosine taper with the length of 5% of the total window length was used at each end. The amplitude spectra of each selected window is computed with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and smoothed using the Konno-Ohmachi function (Bandwidth=40). Then, two horizontal components are merged by squared average. Finally, the H/V spectral ratio of Nakamura is applied for each individual window, and the final predominant frequency is obtained by averaging the H/V spectral ratio of all window. The presence of clear peak on H/V spectral ratio curve is indicative of the impedance contrast between the uppermost surface soil and the underlying hard rock, where large peak values are generally associated with sharp velocity contrasts, and is likely to amplify the ground motion. The H/V spectral ratio in some stations shows a clear peak and at the others might show two or multiple peaks which represents the geologically complex areas. Calculated dominant frequency changes between 0.4 and 2 Hz. These low values indicate the existence of basement at greater depths and large thickness of sediments on basement (Parolai et al., 2002). Site modelling The results of H/V spectral ratio are affected by the local geologic structure. Based on this assumption, we can produce theoretical H/V curve with knowledge of the geologic structure in the area. One-dimensional modelling is a suitable method to evaluation of the site response due to the local geology which requires geotechnical and geophysical data. In the one-dimensional modelling, it is assumed that all boundaries are horizontal in the infinite media and the response of a soil deposit is predominantly caused by SH-wave propagating vertically from the underlying bedrock. In this present study, one-dimensional modelling was carried out using Deepsoil software. Due to the very small deformations in soils by microtremor and producing a low levels of strain, we applied the linear method to evaluate the ground seismic response during mild earthquake shakes. In this software, homogeneous and isotropic soil profile is considered as N horizontal layers. The site response (transfer function) is evaluated by parameters such as layer thickness (m), density (&#961;), shear modulus (G), and damping factor of layers (&#946;), which are obtained from available geotechnical boreholes. Usually, engineering bedrock is considered for the purpose of numerical modelling. According to TC4 (1994), the seismic bedrock was defined as a layer with a shear wave velocity of more than 600 m/s. Shima (1978) recommended that the upper crust with a shear wave velocity of about 3000 m/s, is adopted as bedrock when large scale structures with longer vibration period are being considered. International building code (ICC2000) has defined the seismic bedrock by a shear wave velocity of more than 760 m/s. According to Unified Building Code (UBC97), bedrock is defined into two groups: A (very hard rock with a speed of more than 1500 m/s) and B (rock with a speed of 760 to 1500 m/s). Therefore, the proposed values of the shear wave velocity are different for considering seismic bedrock. In order to consider the uncertainty of the shear wave velocity in the present one-dimensional modelling, three scenarios for the bedrock, were performed with three speeds of 760 m/s (based on engineering bedrock), 1300 m/s (bedrock geology), and 2500 m/s (corresponding to tuff-andesite of the Karaj basement) at different depths, according to the regional geological map. Then, three scenarios of the numerical modelling were compared with microtremor transfer function. 1. One-dimensional modelling at the Karaj site using downhole data for engineering bedrock (&#62; 760 m/s) In order to access the shear wave velocity profile for 1-D modelling, downhole data from 21 boreholes were used in nine sites which were available up to the maximum depth of 50 meters at 20 boreholes and 96 meters at A09 borehole. Low thickness of alluvium (about 17-85 meters) was considered with engineering bedrock (&#62;760 m/s) for numerical modelling. The results represent higher frequency range compared with the microtremor data. In some previous studies where engineering bedrock had been defined by shear wave velocity values between 700 to 800 m/s in 1-D modelling, the results of the theoretical model is incompatible with experimental results. Thus, it seems that it is not suitable to consider the engineering bedrock in 1-D modelling. 2. One-dimensional modelling at Karaj site using microtremor array data for geology bedrock (&#62; 1300 m/s) By considering the seismic bedrock (&#62;760 m/s) at depths of 17 to 85 meters and calculating the one-dimensional transfer function, the peaks in higher frequency compared with the experimental method is observed. According to reliability of experimental H/V results which has been proved by researchers around the world (Haghshenas et al., 2008), the difference between the transfer function results in experimental and theoretical methods indicates that two variables of shear wave velocity or depth of bedrock and alluvium thickness have not been properly modeled. It seems that in order to get better results, it&#8217;s necessary to analysis by considering the geology bedrock at greater depth. Tchalenko, et al., (1974) considered lower part of Plio-Quaternary sediments of Hezardareh Formation and Miocene marl-limestone of Upper Red Formation as the bedrock in the Karaj plain. Shafiee and Azadi (2006) computed shear wave velocity characteristics of these geological units throughout Tehran city. Therefore, a mean velocity of 1300 m/s was considered for the geology bedrock during the modelling. In order to access the shear wave velocity profiles at greater depths, microtremor array stations were designed by seven seismometer with 100 m radius at A09 (site 8) borehole. As it can bee seen, a clear contrast at a depth of about 230 m is observed. Therefore, the modelling was carried out by taking 230 m alluvial thickness on geology bedrock according to lithology of the region. The result of this modelling has shown a peak at frequency range of 0.87 Hz that is compatible with the microtremor peaks at this site. In other site this modelling was performed using array and downhole data. The results indicated that the first effective contrast occurs at depth of 200 to 300 meters. 3. One-dimensional modelling at the Karaj site for basement (&#62; 2500 m/s) Transfer functions obtained from the previous model, did not cover low frequency peaks in the experimental methods. Therefore, the presence of other low-frequency peaks is either due to the geometry of the sedimentary basin or deep contrast. It seems that due to the geology of the region, tuff- andesite of the Karaj Formation as basement plays an important role in the creation of low-frequency peaks. Therefore, to obtain a better model, deep contrast was considered about 2 kilometers due to differences in the type of bedrock with a shear wave velocity of 2500 m/s. For this purpose, according to the properties of the Upper Red Formation, an average constant speed of 1400 (m/s) was considered in modelling and by changing the thickness of this layer, the modelling was continued in a trial and error manner until the numerical model is consistent with microtremor peaks. The modelling results in nine site indicate that there is basement at the depth of 2000 to 2250 meters. Two-dimensional model of the Karaj site Using the one-dimensional analysis and evaluation of the geological map of the area, two dimensional geological structure was rebuilt in studied profiles. Green and gray tuffs and igneous rocks of Karaj Formation outcrops in north of Karaj and constitute the Alborz Mountains. This Mountains eroded by the action of rivers and were deposited in the form of large alluvial fans. Coarse sandy sediments were deposited near mountains wherein energies of rivers and streams were extremely high (site 1 to 4). Furthermore, fine-grained sediments were deposited at far distances by decreasing in the energy of streams (site 5 to 9). Berberian et al (1985) divided B Formation in two parts: heterogeneous deposits of sand, gravel, rock and clay in north of Tehran (Qbn) and silts and clays of Kahrizak (Qbs) in south of Tehran. According to 1-D modelling, thickness of this layer is about 200 to 300 m which has been deposited on geology bedrock. As mentioned before, lower parts of Hezardareh Formation at the north of Karaj and Upper red Formation in the south west of Karaj are considered as geology bedrock. Upper Red Formation was deposited with unconformity on tuff-andesite of the Karaj basement at depths of 2000 to 2250 meters. Conclusions The use of empirical methods based on microtremor is an efficient way to estimate the site effects in Karaj city, although the use of earthquake records could provide better evidence of the depth and geometry of basement. One-dimensional modelling of shear wave velocity profiles obtained from downhole data and considering the engineering bedrock (&#62; 760 m/s) at depths of 17 to 85 meters, is not a good way to estimate the dominant frequency of alluvium. By considering the greater depth of alluvium and using shear wave velocity profiles obtained from microtremor array, 1-D modelling was carried out for geology bedrock (1300 m/s). Therefore, peak frequency in transfer function at the range of 0.87 Hz has been associated with effective contrast at depths of 200 to 300 meters. It seems that Karaj basement (&#62; 2500 m/s) with about 2 kilometers depth plays an important role in the production of low-frequency peaks in transfer function. &#160;},

title = {I Identification and Stabilization of Dispersive Soils: Case Study of Water Transfer Canal of Simindasht-Garmsar}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/2Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 29-50) Introduction In some soils, special phenomena happen with increases in their moisture content that sometimes inflict major damages on development projects. Dispersive soils are one type of such soils. The physico-chemical properties of the particles in dispersive soils cause them to disperse and separate from each other upon contact with water. If dispersive clays are not accurately identified, they will cause damages and failures. In the Simin Dasht region of Semnan Province, some hydraulic structures have incurred serious damages because they are located on dispersive soils. The present research studied the soils around the canal transferring water from the Simin Dasht to Garmsar. This 37-kilometer long canal is situated in Semnan Province between the Simin Dasht and the Garmsar diversion Dams. Scouring and soil erosion under the concrete lining of the canal has led to the destruction of the structure. After visiting the site and taking soil samples, double hydrometer and pinhole tests were performed. The effects of adding various amounts of cement, lime and aluminum nitrate on amending dispersive clays were studied and compared in the Simin Dasht region of Semnan Province. Experiments The effects of the quantities of cement, lime and aluminum amendment materials on stabilization of dispersive soils in the Simin Dasht region of Semnan Province were investigated. Two types of dispersive clayey soils were amended. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the soils. The effects of various amounts of lime, cement, and aluminum nitrate on reduction in the degree of dispersion in the tested soils were studied. The cement, lime, and soil samples were dried at 40˚C for 24 hours. It must be mentioned that the amount of added lime, cement, and aluminum nitrate were zero, 3, 5, and 7 percent. Table1. Characteristics of dispersive soils used in this reserch Gs Optimum Moisture (%) Plasticity Index, PI (%) Plastic limit, PL (%) Liquid limit, LL (%) Natural water content (%) Soil 2.72 15 2.54 15.09 17.63 13.84 A 2.66 11 6.33 16.11 22.44 3.02 B Results Average changes in discharge passing through the dispersive soil samples A and B, and through samples of these soils amended with lime, cement, and aluminum nitrate in pinhole tests are presented in Figures 1(a-f), respectively. Figure 1a indicates that the behavior of the A soil samples amended with lime did not follow any specific trend, but we can cautiously say that soil A will become non-dispersive when lime is added at 4.5 percent at all moisture contents. Increases in the quantities of the cement added to the dispersive soils A and B to stabilize them independent of the moisture content of the soils were also investigated (Figure 1c, d). Behavior of the A soil samples stabilized with aluminum nitrate followed a specific trend (Figure 1 e, f) contrary to those amended with the other stabilizers. Conclusions Results of the tests show that dispersion in soil A was amended (without completely preventing the occurrence of the scouring phenomenon) by the addition of cement or lime at 5 percent or aluminum nitrate at 3 percent. Moreover, dispersion in soil B was amended by the addition of cement at 3 percent, lime at 5 percent, or aluminum nitrate at 3 percent. Aluminum nitrate was a better and more effective amendment material for the dispersive soils compared to lime. Therefore, aluminum ions replaced the other ions in the structure of dispersive clays more suitably compared to calcium ions. Comparison of the results obtained from the pinhole tests performed on soil samples amended with aluminum nitrate, lime, and cement suggests that it took a shorter time for the samples to be stabilized with aluminum nitrate compared to the other two amendment materials.

title = {Value Engineering Based on Monitoring During Tunnel Excavation Phase-a Case Study of Hakim Tunnel}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/3Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 51-72) Introduction Value engineering is considered an efficient alternative to improve design and construction process of urban tunneling projects. Application of value engineering techniques can provide investigating all aspects of a project in a team work, creative and short-time manner which contribute to precisely identify a project&#8217;s quality improvement issues, construction time and costs. Hakim Expressway one of the capital's main highways in Tehran metropolis with 9 Km in length, starts from the junction of Resalat expressway and Kurdistan expressway after Resalat tunnel and ends in Lashgari expressway. The west extended this highway passing through the area of Chitgar forest park. Due to environmental constraints, the Hakim twin tunnels with cross-section of 186 m2 excavation areas and total length of 3256 m to the NATM/SEM method in this area were excavated (Figure 1). In preliminary design of Hakim tunnel project, on category of excavation and support system was suggested. During the tunnel&#8217;s excavation operation, the behavior and classification of the tunnel were investigated from field observation, instrumentation and monitoring of geological models and subsequently, further excavation process was modified in accordance with value engineering. The aim of using value engineering approach in this project was to reduce the costs without any decrease in quality, employer satisfaction along with minimum risk and as well as improving operational and practical aspects. Ultimately, establishment of the value engineering approach on Hakim tunneling project leads to 10% reduction in construction costs as well as relevant quality with the least challenges (Figure 2). General Geology The city of Tehran is founded on Quaternary alluvium, which has been geologically classified by Rieben [1]. The city is located at the foot of the Alborz mountain range, which is basically composed of Eocene pyroclastic deposits (green tuff) and other volcanic rocks. The geology and the morphology of the Tehran region is similar to that for other cities located at the foot of mountains. Rieben (1966) divided the Tehran coarse-grained alluvia into four categories, identified as A, B, C and D, where A is the oldest and D the youngest (Figure 3). Hakim tunnel project locates on foothills of northern Tehran, crossing the hills of Chitgar forest park. Results of field surveys indicate that alluvial deposits in tunnel track belong to C (ramps and tunnel portal) and A formations (in most parts of tunnel track). Geotechnical characterization Table1 summarizes soil input parameters. Two soil types were considered for the model with 8- meter-height overburden. First layer (No.1) starts from surface with a 1 meter thickness. Second layer (No. 2) has 7 meter thickness. Table1. Summary of the geotechnical parameters Parameter Unit Layer No. 1 Layer No. 1 Internal friction angle (CU) Deg. 29 33 Cohesion (CU) Kg/cm2 0.15 0.45 Density Kg/cm3 18.5 20 Poisson ratio of unloading/reloading Kg/cm2 0.2 0.2 Secant deformation modulus Kg/cm2 550 900 Power of stress level of stiffness 0.5 0.5 Stiffness unloading Kg/cm2 1650 2700  During tunnel excavation using field observations, the results of the monitoring and reviewing the geological model, ground behavior and classification were re-examined to optimization of the excavation and support class (Figures 4, 5). Detailed analysis before excavation and continuation of studies led to two excavation and support classes purposed for Hakim tunnel. Both classes of excavation and support due to ground conditions are modeled and analyzed using software Plaxis. For verification, the results of numerical analysis using monitoring and field observations were compared during the tunnel excavation. The results of monitoring compliance with the results of numerical analysis were appropriate. Implementation and construction costs were calculated for different sections of two excavation and support classes in accordance to contraction documents to evaluate the effect of optimization in design (Figures 6, 7) &#160; Figure4. Excavation sequence in excavation and support class &#8220;A&#8221; Results Results indicate that in both classes maximum costs are related to excavation section while minimum costs are for invert and mucking. In all concrete spray operations there was just a %3.5 increase in costs. Overall savings in excavation and support was about %10 which is significant (Figure 8). Figure8.

title = {Modification of Schimazek Abrasivity Index for Improving its Application in Rock Engineering}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/4Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 73-90) Introduction Up to now, various indexes and methods have been presented for evaluating the abrasivity of rocks. In total, these methods can be divided to two main groups; the methods based on nature of rocks, methods based on heuristic tools. Schimazek F-abrasivity index is one of the most powerful and applicable indexes for evaluating the rock abrasiveness. This index uses the grain size, Brazilian tensile strength and equivalent quartz content for abrasivity analysis. Since the values of these parameters are equal in Schimazek index, therefore, in some cases this index doesn't have suitable ability to distinguish and classify the rock abrasiveness. This paper tries to modify the Schimazek index considering the weights of its applied parameters. Material and Methods In this research, Fuzzy Delphi Analytical Hierarchy Process (FDAHP) has been used to calculate the weight of dominant parameters in rock abrasivity. For this purpose several questioners have been distributed and the expert opinions were collected. The results showed that the quartz content, grain size and tensile strength have the weight of 0.4, 0.31 and 0.29 respectively and new Schimazek F-abrasivity index is as presented in equation (1). &#160;&#160; &#160; In the next stage, in order to facilitate the application of new index, a new classification system was developed. This classification and related weighing graphs (Figure 1) help to change the discontinuous classification to continuous one. Results and discussions In order to verify the application of the new developed index, ten ornamental stones have been studied and the old and modified Schimazek indexes were calculated for all of them. Then, the cutting rate (sawing rate) of each stone was recorded in laboratory and the mathematical relationships between new and old indexes have been achieved. The results show that the new Schimazek abrasivity index has higher ability to predict the cutting rate than old one (Figure 2).&#160; &#160; Figure1. Continuous weighting for parameters of Schimazek F-abrasivity index Figure2. Regression of old and new Schimazek F-abrasivity index with cutting rate of granite ornamental stones Conclusion Generally it could be concluded that, the main weakness of Schimazek F-abrasivity index which is the equality of parameters&#8217; importance, has been removed by idea developed and confirmed in this study. The different weights which allocated to grain size, Brazilian tensile strength and equivalent quartz content in study, improves the Schimazek index applicability in rock engineering applications specially rock cutting and drilling. Therefore, it is recommended to use new method instead of old one in future applications. &#160; &#160;},

title = {Comparative Study of Information Value, Density Area, LNRF, Frequency Ratio Mmethods in Landslide Zoning at Poshtdarband Region, Kermanshah Province}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/5Extended_Abstract.pdf&#160;Extended Abstract &#160;(Paper pages 91-114) Introduction Due to possibility of occurrence in various natural environments and the variety of natural and artificial factors that affect landslides, landslide has special importance in natural hazards. Depending on the landform, several factors can cause or accelerate the landslide. According to previous researches, Human activities, land morphology, geological setting, slope, aspect, climate conditions, proximity to some watershed features such as rivers and faults are the most important parameters. Landslides occur frequently each year and they can cause heavy losses which compensating some of them requires a lot of money and time. Assessing landslide related hazards with only limited background information and data is a constant challenge for engineers, geologists, planners, landowners, developers, insurance companies, and government entities. The landslide occurrence in terms of time and place are not easily predictable, for this reason, Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) or Landslide Susceptibility Zonation (LSZ) maps are used to predict the happening of landslides. A landslide susceptibility map depicts areas likely to have landslides in the future by correlating some of the principal factors that contribute to landslides with the past distribution of slope failures. These maps are basic tools for land-use planning, especially in mountain areas. Landslide susceptibility mapping relies on a rather complex knowledge of slope movements and their controlling factors. The reliability of landslide susceptibility maps mostly depends on the amount and quality of available data, the working scale and the selection of the appropriate methodology of analysis and modeling. Such maps are obtained by dividing of a region into near-homogeneous domains and weighting them according to the degree of possible hazard of a landslide. There are two ways to do landslide hazard zonation: (i) a qualitative approach that is based on expert knowledge of the target area and portrays susceptibility zoning in descriptive terms; and, (ii) a quantitative approach based on statistical algorithms. In the present study of landslide susceptibility zonation, bivariate statistical methods (information value, density area, LNRF, frequency ratio) were used. In bivariate statistical analysis, each factor map is combined with the landslide distribution map and weighting values based on landslide densities are calculated for each parameter class. Materials and Methods The best method for studying landslides, which has long been of interest to researchers, is hazard zonation. In this method due to the affecting factors in landslide occurrence, the study area is classified into areas with low to very high risk. Such zonation could be of great help in regional planning. Different methods have been developed for this purpose. In this research four bivariate statistical methods namely information value, density area, LNRF, and frequency ratio are used to investigate the hazard zonation in Poshtdarband region, Kermanshah province. The study began with the preparation of a landslide inventory map. The instability factors used in this study included geology, land use, normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), slope gradient, aspect, distance from faults, distance from surface water, distance from roads, profile curvature and plan curvature. Landslide area ratio was calculated in classes of effective factors maps and weighted by four bivariate statistical methods. In addition, landslide hazard zonation maps were obtained from algebraic sum of weighted maps with regard to breakpoints of frequency curve. Finally, by using density ratio (Dr) Index through all four methods hazard classes were compared and with the help of quality sum (Qs) and precision (P) indexes these four methods were compared and evaluated. Results and Discussion If the landslide susceptibility analyses are performed effectively, they can help engineers, contractors, land use planners, etc. minimize landslide. In this study, bivariate statistical methods were applied to generate landslide susceptibility maps using the instability factors. The bivariate approach computes the frequency of landslides with respect to each input factor separately, and the final susceptibility map is a simple combination of all the factors irrespective of their relative significance in causing landslides in a particular region. In table 1 subclasses of instability factors which had the highest value in different methods, are summarized. The density ratio indexes (Dr), quality sum indices (Qs) and precision indices (P) were used to compare the methods. By overlaying the landslide inventory map of the study area and landslide hazard zonation maps, quality sum (Qs) and precision (P) indices introduce a suitable model for the studied region, and density ratio index (Dr) introduces division precision among the zones or hazard classes in each zonation model.

Conclusion Frequency ratio, density area and information value methods showed that forest land use, slope and slope shape factors have the highest impacts on a landslide occurrence. The LNRF method showed that geology factors, pasture land use and distance from surface water had the greatest role in landslide making. For frequency ratio, information value, and density area methods, the effective factors in landslide are the same, however through the LNRF method, the three factors which have the greatest impact on landslide happening, are generally different from the three other methods. The density ratio values show that density area and frequency ratio methods respectively have more accuracy and applicability within all used methods for separating hazard classes in the study area. The quality sum (Qs) results indicate that although there are minor differences, the frequency ratio compared to the density area method was more accurate and more applicable for separating landslide hazard in the Poshtdarband region. The calculated results of P index indicated that among the used methods, the density area method with a nuance of the frequency ratio method is the most suitable method for the study area.},

title = {Effect of Slope on Interstory Drift of Steel Moment Resistant Frames in Soft Soil  }, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/6Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 115-134) Introduction Different factors should be considered in investigating soil- structure interaction for which we can refer to underground layers material properties, site shape and topography and entry motion. It has been showed that seismic waves will be reflected and makes more strange seismic waves in comparison with the state of without slope. To investigate the topography effects the various assumptions such as considering the rigid and compliant bedrock, half space, stimulations with different frequencies, slopes with different angles, different heights of slopes, and soil type were evaluated.&#160; In this study topography effects on interstory drift of three structures with steel moment resistant frame system is considered, for this aim 6 combined model of soil- structure and topography is investigated. Three structures of 6, 9 and 12 story placed in near and far from of crest of a slope and 10 earthquake on bedrock has been applied to models. Interstory drift is considered as a criteria for investigating topography effect. Material and Methods This paper examines 3 planar steel moment resistant frame (SMRF) which have been previously designed by&#160;Karavasilis et al (2007)&#160;according to&#160;EC3&#160;and&#160;EC8. These structures have 3 bays, and 6, 9, 12 stories. The length of each bay and the height of each story are 5 and 3 m, respectively. Furthermore, the amount of dead and live loads are considered in accordance with the current study&#160;(Minasidis et al 2014). The study frames were modeled in ABAQUS software in the form of two-dimensional (Figure&#160;2). A36 steel is used in the models and the yield strength of steel is 235 MPa. Modeling of the behavior of steel was implemented using the yield criterion of VON MISES and taking into account the non-linear behavior of materials and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. A kinematic material hardening of 3% is assumed for the nonlinear elements and a Rayleigh damping of 5% is assumed for the first two modes of each frame. In this study,&#160;&#160; a slope with &#945;=20 is considered. The characteristics of the slope and the soil of the region are obtained by borehole in different point based on&#160;Ghanbari et al 2011&#160;study. Figure1. Growth percentage in average amount of interstory drift The desired slope has a height of 30 m. The depth of the bedrock is considered equal to 60 m. The numerical analyses were performed with the Finite element method, for nonlinear soil with VS=238 m/s, Poisson&#8217;s ratio v=0.35 and mass density &#961;=1800 kg/m3. Moreover, to estimate the distribution of response, 10 records located on the bedrock (shear wave velocity is more than 650 m/s) have been used. To reduce the near source effect records are selected in such a way that they have no pulse in velocity time history and Distance from source to site greater than 10 km considered Result Result showed that interstory drift of structures increases due to topography effects, but this increase varies for different structures and earthquakes. Growth percentage in average amount of interstory drift are 25, 15 and 6 percent for structures with 6, 9 and 12 story respectively. Also for structure 9 and 12 story, interstory drift was decrease in some stories. &#160; &#160;},

title = { Effect of Cyclic Loading on the Mechanical Properties and Fatigue Behavior of Tonalite Rocks }, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/7Extended_Abstract.pdfExtended Abstract &#160;(Paper pages 135-156) Introduction Many civil structures (e.g. tunnel walls, bridge pillars, dam abutments and road foundations) are subjected to both static and dynamic loads. Cyclic loading leads to occurring fatigue phenomenon. Fatigue is the tendency of materials to break, or the process of damage accumulation, under cyclic loading. It was found that the dynamic fatigue strength can be reduced by 30-70 percent on average compared to uniaxial compression strength. Different materials show different response when they are subjected to cyclic loading. Some materials become stronger and more ductile, while others become weaker and more brittle. Although it is clear that the mechanical properties of rock under dynamic loads varied dramatically from those under static loads, the nature of dynamic failure in rock remains unclear, especially in cyclic loading condition. Fatigue behavior of rocks was rarely studied in respect to other materials such as steel and soil. The performed researches on fatigue behavior of rocks indicated that fatigue life will be decreased by increasing load amplitude in logarithmic and exponentially pattern. Also, strain softening is the dominated behavior of rocks against cyclic loading. Furthermore, some parameters such as maximum load level, confining pressures, amplitude, and loading frequency have considerable effects on fatigue behavior of rocks. However, available data on fatigue behavior remain insufficient for solving the practical tasks of predicting rock bursts and earthquakes. Obtained results are inconclusive and sometimes discordant. The aim of the current work was to assess tonalite rock fatigue behaviour under different loading conditions to describe the fatigue damage process of the granitic rock. Material and methods Several core samples were prepared to perform this research. The core samples were prepared with a L/D ratio of 2.5 with an average diameter of 54 mm. Before the fatigue tests, the physical and mechanical properties of the rocks were measured. Uniaxial compressive strength test (UCS) has been done on 5 core samples. The tests were performed in the load-control mode with a 1.6 kN/s loading rate. The tests were conducted to obtain the physico-mechanical parameters of the rocks in static loading condition, and provided a reference for subsequent dynamic tests. The cyclic tests were performed in both load and displacement control modes. To record axial and lateral strains during the fatigue tests, four strain gauges have been employed with arrangement of two axial and two laterals. Also, three acoustic emission sensors were installed on top, mean and bottom of the core samples to record cracking sound. In order to doing the tests a servocontrol Instron machine with 500 kN capacity was employed. The fatigue tests were conducted with three different maximum loads, 1 Hz frequency, and constant amplitude (0.82 of uniaxial compressive strength). The maximum stress level (the ratio of maximum cyclic stress to static strength) was varied 0.80, 0.85, and 0.90. The amplitude level (the ratio of amplitude stress to static strength) ranged from 0.50 to 0.70 and 0.90. Finally, Multi stages loading with increasing amplitude were applied for the displacement control tests. The results of fatigue tests have been evaluated by fatigue damage parameters including maximum and minimum axial strain, maximum and minimum lateral strain, tangent and secant modulus, toughness and hysteresis energy. Results and discussion The obtained results indicated that during fatigue process failure occurs below the maximum strength loading condition as a result of accumulative damage. Analysis of the fatigue test results showed that the fatigue failure consisted of three stages: fatigue crack formation (initiation phase I), stable crack propagation (uniform velocity phase II), and unstable crack propagation resulting in a sudden breakdown (accelerated phase III). By comparing the axial and lateral deformation, it was found that lateral deformation is more sensitive to fatigue. At higher stress levels, considerable part of fatigue life is response to crake development, whereas at lower stress levels, crack acceleration phase of fatigue life is distinguishable. Descending trend of loading and unloading tangent modulus shows a scatter pattern. This behavior may be related to the calculation method and loading condition, as well as microstructure and behavior of the rock mass. In spite of tangent modulus results, the three-stages of damage process (especially phase I and II) for secant modulus in both loading and unloading conditions are clear. The result is due to the method of calculation and increase in axial strain with increasing number of cycles. Brittle behavior of this type of rock leads acceleration phase to be hidden and unclear in most of fatigue damage parameters. A dramatic decrease of toughness and hysteresis energy in the first few cycles is due to the closing of pre-existing micro fractures. In fact, during the initial cycle, the rock behaves in a more ductile fashion than in the next few cycles. Thereafter, toughness begins to increase slowly, then steadily, and finally rapidly. A similar behavior was found for hysteresis energy as well. This fact indicated that cracks generated in parallel to loading direction. Fatigue displacement control tests show a strain softening behavior for the granitic rocks. This behavior is highlighted in variation of maximum stress during the tests. This parameter, especially in final step of loading, shows distinguishable decreasing trend. Conclusion The tonalite rocks were subjected to uniaxial cyclic loading in both load and displacement control mode. The following conclusions were drawn from this research. -Accumulated fatigue damage occurs in an obvious three-stage process. This is the result of the micro-fracturing mechanism in the fatigue process. -By comparing axial and lateral strain damages, it was found that crack propagation occurred in the loading direction and crack opening occurred in the lateral direction. So, among fatigue damage parameters, lateral strain shows the best three-stage fatigue damage behavior. - Strain softening was found as rock response to cyclic displacement control loading.},

title = {Representing an Empirical Relationship for the Estimating Mode I Fracture Toughness of Rock Obtained from Testing on SCB Specimen using Tensile Strength}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/1.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages157-174) Introduction Considering the fact that the estimation of mode &#160;fracture toughness by testing is time-consuming and expensive. It might be associated with certain practical difficulties. Therefore, many researchers have attempted to propose experimental relationships in order to capture these problems. Gunsallus et al. (1984) and Bhagat (1985) experimentally found that mode &#160;fracture toughness is related to tensile strength. Whittaker et al. (1992) have also proposed a number of relationships between mode I fracture toughness, tensile strength, point load index, uniaxial compressive strength and the velocity of sound waves. Bearman (1999) obtained an experimental relationship between mode I fracture toughness and point load index, while Brown et al. (1997) presented an experimental relationship between this parameter and density. Up to now no significant research effort has been made in this field in Iran, only Ayatollahi and Fatehi addressed rock fracture toughness. Although, Ayatollahi has not presented any experimental relationships. In the present research the three-point bending test was used on a cylindrical specimen containing a straight crack in order to determine the mode &#160;fracture toughness, and the Brazilian test was employed to determine tensile strength. Materials and Methods The tests were carried out on six types of rocks, namely gray sandstone, tuff, lithic tuff, travertine, andesite, and limestone. Sandstone, travertine, and limestone are sedimentary rocks, while andesite is an extrusive igneous rock, and tuff and lithic tuff are pyroclastic rocks (pyroclastic rocks resulting from volcanic eruptions that harden by sedimentation). Therefore, the studied rocks have different origins. In order to carry out the Brazilian and the three-point bending test, cores were prepared from these blocks. In order to perform the three-point bending test, specimens with diameter of 73 mm with a thickness of 30 mm were used. The samples were cut in two semicircular by a cutting machine, and a notch with length of 15 mm is created by a diamond saw.&#160; Notch is vertical in the center of the semicircular samples. The Brazilian test was performed on disc shaped specimens. In order to perform the Brazilian test, specimens with diameter of 51 mm and thick of 25 mm were used. The specimens are carefully placed under the curved jaws of the machine and then loaded until fracture. Results and Discussion A summary of the Brazilian and the three-point bending test results are presented in Table 1. The average value of test result pertaining to each rock is reported in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of the Brazilian and the three-point bending test results Specimen Tensile Strength (MPa) Fracture Toughness (MPa&#8730;m) Limestone 3.74 1.23 Sandstone 7.14 1.63 Tuff 16.36 2.17 Lithic Tuff 4.34 1.01 Andesite 13.25 1.86 Travertine 8.27 1.14  In this study, it was attempted to propose an experimental relationship between mode I fracture toughness and the tensile strength of the rock. In order to determine the relationship between the tensile strength and the fracture toughness, the tensile strength vs. fracture toughness diagram was plotted in Excel to obtain Eq. 1 and the coefficient of determination (R2) (Figure 1). The coefficient of determination (R2) in Eq. 1 shows that almost 80 percent of the mode I fracture toughness variations can be estimated using the linear relationship (Eq. 1). The relationship is applicable for determining the mode I fracture toughness resulting from the three-point bending test on semicircular specimens containing a straight crack. In the following, the results of this study are compared to those reported by Whittacker (1992) and Zhang (2002). In order to examine the accuracy of the presented relationships, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measure was used which is computed from Eq. 2. In the best case, RMSE is zero.&#160; In the relationships, &#160; represents the fracture toughness obtained from testing while &#160;is the fracture toughness estimated using the relationships. Comparison of the obtained results indicate that the proposed relationship has the capability of precise estimation of the mode I fracture toughness of rocks. Conclusion Given the many difficulties associated with the direct estimation of fracture toughness, indirect estimation methods have been proposed. One of such methods is the estimation of mode I fracture toughness using tensile strength. A linear relationship with a coefficient of determination of 0.7977 was proposed. The accuracy of this relationship has been verified by comparing its results to those from previous studies. &#160;},

title = {A Numerical Study on Contact and Noncontact Pile Performance}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/2.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages175-200) Introduction In weak soils with low bearing capacity, the load transfer is done using piles. Therefore, by creating an interposed layer separating the pile from the raft, reactions between raft and pile head will be reduced and the load-bearing role of shallow soil will be more than contact pile situation. Normally, the pile head and shallow soil have a settlement equal to the raft. Thus, the relative settlement of pile and soil in pile head is equal to zero and at the bottom is high and the body friction mobilizes upward. In addition, a portion of load is tolerated by shallow soil and the other portion is tolerated by the pile head, which would be transferred to deeper soil layers. In noncontact state, with the formation of a hard soil layer on which the raft is located, soil mechanical parameters will be improved; while in contact state, the settlement will be decreased by reducing the amount of transferred load to the shallow soil. The transferred load to the shallow soil increases vertical and horizontal stress around piles, so bearing capacity of piles is increased. Methodology In this study, a parametric study has been performed concerning contact and noncontact piles using finite element software namely, ABAQUS/CAE software version 6.13.1 and the obtained results were compared (with what? The sentence is incomplete). Thus, simulations are is done for states of 0, 1, 4 and 9 piles for each of the contact and noncontact piles (total of 8 simulations). In the present research two models were taken to investigate the optimum mesh sizes, 12 models for parametric studies on parameters of piles&#8217; length, piles&#8217; diameter, thickness of the raft and interposed layer and one model for verification study. Models in both contact and noncontact have been considered with a one meter interposed layer. Raft width and thickness were selected 7.5 and 1.6 m, respectively. Width and depth of the soil mass used in the model were 32 and 26 m, respectively, and the distance between the bottom of the pile and the soil mass was 13 m. In all cases, the diameter of piles was 0.5 m and distance between piles were 5 and 2.5 m in 4 and 9 states, respectively. The geotechnical parameters and model dimensions used, were selected according to the Fioravante &#38; Girettis (2010) [1]. Sand and silica-sand with the defined properties were used for the soil mass and the interposed layer, respectively. Since Drucker-Prager criteria has better ability to express the behavior of coarse-grained soils, this criterion was used in the modeling [2]. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of interposed layer on bearing capacity and settlement of pile. Hence, because of simplifying the process of modeling, parameters of main soil and interposed layer are mostly similar. Piles and raft are made of concrete with an elasticity modulus of 21 GPa, Poisson's ratio of 0.2 and density of 2300 kg/m3. The crack growth analysis with the compressive stress-plastic strain was used to express the fracture behavior of concrete [2, 3 &#38; 4]. In the present study, frictional and vertical contacts between surfaces were considered for conducting interactions between different materials. For frictional contact, the penalty formulation with the fixed friction coefficient of tan&#948; was used where &#948; is the angle of friction. The penalty formulations and hard contact were applied between two surfaces for the normal contact. Interactions were considered in the modeling including raft-soil mass, raft-interposed layer, pile-raft, interposed layer-soil mass, interposed layer-pile and the soil-pile [5 &#38; 6]. Coefficient of soil lateral pressure used in this study corresponds to k0=0.65 which is introduced in many geotechnical conditions [7]. A uniform distributed vertical load 500 kPa was applied on the raft. For getting results in every portion of loading time, this amount is applied in order of 5 kPa in each time interval. To accelerate the process of analysis and because of the symmetry of all models in two directions of X and Y, the quarter model technique was used, so that movements in the direction perpendicular to the sheet and rotation around perpendicular axes on the sheet were not allowed on the border of symmetry. The boundaries of the models due to the enough distance from the piles were considered in a way that lateral displacement and rotation around the vertical axis was not allowed. Furthermore, the bottom of the soil mass was considered as complete fix due to the enough distance from the pile foot. Conclusion In this research, a numerical &#8211; parametric study is performed on special kind of piles named noncontact piles and results are compared with contact piles. Results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. By increasing the number of piles from 1 to 9, the settlement reduced more in a noncontact state showing more effectiveness of implementing 9 contactpiles and thus requiring more piles in this case. 2. Soil surface stress differences in noncontacts states from 4 to 9 piles was less than contact state (approximately 1/7) indicating that more piles is needed to conduct the contact state. 3. Stress changes in the soil under the pile in noncontact state by adding piles from 1 to 4 was higher than adding piles from 4 to 9 indicating the suitability of using 4 noncontact piles; while, in the contact state, the stress changes in the soil under the pile in both cases from 1 to 4 piles and from 4 to 9 piles was noteworthy showing the necessity of using the ninth pile. 4. Unlike the states of 4 and 9 piles, the negative friction in noncontact state and 1 pile was seen along the piles, which can be due to the fewer piles and the effect of interposed layer density as well as soil mass at greater depthsbecause of lesser effect of piles in load-bearing. 5. The ratio of heads load in the contact to the noncontact piles was about 2.5 to 4 reflecting the positive impact of using interposed layer on load reduction and smaller cross-layer design for piles. In addition, the ratio of heads load in the contact to the noncontact piles was higher for 4 piles than 9 piles that represented the suitability of using 4 piles. 6. Based on the results of geometric parametric studies it is found that: (A) By resizing the elements from 0.25 to 0.5 m, the results had not changed and only time of analysis was increased. (B) Among three values of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 m for interposed layer thicknesses, the thickness of 1 m was enough and had a good effect on the stress distribution and involving shallow soil in bearing vertical stress. (C) The raft thickness of 1.6 m was appropriate so that with this thickness, the resultant effect of increasing vertical loads (raft weight) and increased rigidity due to increased raft thickness caused the stress and settlements remain in a reasonable range. (D) Due to the increased friction by increasing in diameter, the optimal diameter of 0.5 m was achieved for piles which reduced the settlement by receiving more load. (E) Among three pile lengths of 10, 19 and 25 m, the optimal length was 19 m; so that by further increase in the length, stresses and settlements were not noticeably changed.In total, noncontact piles had better performance compared to contact piles in similar conditions.

title = {An Study on the Effects of Nail Arrangement on the Stability and Performance of Soil Nailed Walls}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/3.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 201-224) Introduction Soil nails are traditionally designed with uniform length and equal spacing to stabilize slopes which do not meet safety requirements. However, nails with uniform layout in a slope may not be the optimal design if the construction cost is taken into account. The optimal layouts lead to a minimum usage of nails and satisfies the allowable factor of safety and wall deformation. In this study a decreasing trend of nails length along the wall height was considered to investigate the stability and the performance of the wall in different nail patterns. Then nail density was introduced as an important factor on the overall stability and deformation of the wall. It can be beneficial in the preliminary estimation of the required nail length at the beginning of a project. Findings of this study are helpful for effective design of soil&#8211;nailed slopes. Materials and Methods The finite element analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of nails pattern on the overall stability and deformation of soil&#8211;nailed walls. Slope/W software was used to obtain the Factor of safety and Plaxis 2D was used to calculate the deformation of the soil nail walls. Soil hardening model was used to simulate the behavior of soil. In this study, various walls with different specifications were modeled and analyzed. As an example, a 10 m deep soil nail wall with C=10 kN/m2, ?=25 deg, Eoed=20000 kN/m2 is discussed here to monitor the trends (C represents cohesion, ? is the angle of friction and Eoed is the modulus of elasticity of the soil). As it is shown in Figure 1, by considering the decreasing trend of nail length along the wall height, an ordered arrangement (pattern) is introduced by presenting &#8220;L&#8221; as the base nail length and &#8220;&#8221; as the inclination of stabilized zone border then, the effect of nail arrangement on the safety factor and deformation of nailed wall is investigated. The nails were installed with an angle of 15 degrees relative to the horizon. According to FHWA a minimum value of 1.35 is considered for the factor of safety. Circular failure surfaces are assumed and the tensile and pullout resistance of the nails crossing the failure surfaces are considered as the governing stabilizing forces. Results and discussion In this study, soil nails pattern effects on the performance and the stability of the soil nail wall are investigated. In Figure 2 variation of safety factors caused by different soil nails arrangements is illustrated. Generally three separated trends are observed in each curve. It demonstrates that at lower values of  with small bond length, the factor of safety is constant. As  increases the bond length behind the slip surface becomes longer and the safety factor is increases gradually. Eventually it reaches a point that the nails are long enough that increasing the nails length is not influential in the stability of the wall. Hence, nails at different elevations of a slope have different contribution to the overall stability of soil&#8211;nailed slopes. Wall deformations need to be controlled by the allowable deformation level in designing the soil nailed wall especially when buildings or other underground facilities exist near the excavation. One of the most important parameters on soil nailed wall deformations is the arrangement of nail lengths. Figure 3 shows the effect of nail arrangements on the wall horizontal deflection. In general, as and L increase, horizontal deflection of the wall decreases. The rate of this reduction is higher in lower base length. As it is &#160; illustrated in Figure 3, by increasing the length of the nails, the deflection is decreased till no significant reduction is observed. As it is shown the arrangement and the layout of the nails are influential on the stability and deformation of the soil nailed walls. However, it is important to identify an optimal layout in a way that with optimum nail length, allowable stability is reached and the wall deformation stay in an allowable range. Nail density is defined as the ratio of the required nail length per the unit area of the wall surface and defined as below: where Li is nail length of each row and A is the stabilization area. Hence, estimating the nail density can be beneficial for the engineers to have a preliminary estimation of the costs of the project at beginning of the project. Figure 4 indicates that the nail density governs the wall deformation. As it is seen, for different layouts with the same nail density, the resulted deflections are so close. Hence, it can be concluded that nail density is a key factor in determination of the wall deflection. It is also illustrated that, as the nail density increases, the reduction rate of the deflection is decreased. Effective nail density is defined as a threshold point that increasing the nail density is no longer effective on deformations. As it is demonstrated in Figure 5, different layouts with a similar nail density have close values of safety factors. In walls with higher nail density increasing the nail length is fruitless and at lower nail density nails are not effective. So Optimum designation should be somewhere at the middle part with an allowable factor of safety. In the middle part the variation of factors of safety is more tangible. Horizontal deflection profile During the construction process the wall tends to move outward. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of soil nails arrangements on the deformation of a 10 m deep wall for a constant base length. As it is shown, by increasing  the horizontal deflection at the top of the wall decreases in a way that at higher  values, the wall deformation mode changes from overturning mode to bulging mode. Conclusion In this paper the effects of soil nail arrangement on the stability and performance of the wall was investigated. An ordered arrangement of the nails was introduced and the effect of various nail lengths at different elevations of the wall was discussed. Major findings concluded from this research are summarized as follows: Nail density was defined as a key parameter and the findings demonstrate that nail density plays an important role in controlling the stability and the performance of the soil nail walls, in a way that patterns with the same nail densities but different arrangements, result in the almost similar factors of safety and deformations. Therefore based on the allowable factor of safety and deformation, nail density can be concluded and the nail arrangement which meets the standards, is selected. Threshold nail density is defined as a value of nail density which no significant reduction of deflection happens afterward. Uniform distribution of the nails and lower values of  generates the maximum deflection at the top of the wall. As  increases, the bond length in the upper parts of the wall controls the deformation. In that case, the deflection value is bounded and the maximum deflection occurs at the middle depth of the wall. Therefore the mode of deformation changes from overturning mode to bulging mode. As a result, in the projects which their adjacent structures are of high importance, it is recommended to use more&#160; &#160;},

title = { Effect of Adding Nanoclay on the Geotechnical Behavior of Fine-grained Soft Soils }, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/4.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 225-246) &#160;Introduction Soil has always been a major material in civil projects. Due to progress in science, different studies on the behavior of soil and its engineering characteristics have been conducted. As mentioned, there are different types of soil in nature; a small change in their structure and fabric under different environmental conditions or loading causes high deformation and settlements, which result in a reduction of strength and bonding between soil particles. Also, in this regard, some soft soils exist that are mostly composed of clay particles, with small shear strength and big settlement under low stress. With respect to the above-mentioned characteristics, these soils are referred to as problematic soils. The problematic soils consist of a silicate combination, whose major parts are clay minerals formed under weathering of rocks. Additionally, the precipitation of some soils and ground activity near the surface causes them to become problematic (Beckwith and Hansen [1]). Principally, in engineering, those soils on which construction is not safe, and which are affected by different environmental conditions, are defined as problematic soils. Collapsible soils are some of the most important of these problematic soils. The collapsibility phenomenon is defined as a sudden collapse of soil caused by the loss of the shear strength of soils. The collapsible potential depends on the initial void ration of soils. A few silty strata that are exposed to arid weather are susceptible to considerable volume decrease or collapse under soil saturation. Therefore, it is possible that surface water penetration in an irrigation form, pipe leakage and rise in ground water level may lead to great settlement. In the last decade, the use of nanotechnology based on the science of production and nano-scale particles usage has become prevalent in many sciences. It can be said that nanoparticle application has made considerable progress, apart from nanotechnology, in recent years and has been one of its main aspects of this study. In this regard, the variety of nanoparticle depends on different applications. The use of nano-materials has drawn the attention of various researchers in geotechnical engineering. One of the important nano-materials is nanoclay which, with respect to its characteristics, has had a wide range of applications in soil improvement techniques. Taha and Taha [2] and Majid et al. [3] have studied the effects of nano-materials, such as nanoluminum, nanocopper and nanoclay, on the swelling and shrinkage behavior in fine grain-size soils. Also, the compressive strength and permeability of soils increase and decrease with the addition of nanoclay, respectively, and are subjected to change of elastic to plastic behavior (Burton et al. 2009 [4], Gallagher and Lin [5], Persoff et al. [6]). In this research, the main objective is to investigate the addition of nanoclay on the behavior of fine grain-size soil with experimental studies and to evaluate the different parameters on the soils&#8217; modification mechanisms. Material and methods Given the importance of this subject and the practical use of the results of this research in the improvement of problematic soils, as well as the field assessment conducted, it was observed that, in many parts of the main irrigation channels of Gonbad dam in northeastern Iran, which is an arid and semi-arid region of Iran, due to the specific geotechnical conditions and loess soils, large and non-uniform subsidence of soil has occurred around dewatering channels. This has caused large cracks to occur in the concrete channel coverage and subsoil and the surrounding wall soil, which ultimately will lead to the destruction of large parts of the channel mentioned above. Remarkably, given the nature of loess soils in the study area, dangers such as collapsibility, dispersivity, landslides, sinkholes and subsidence can be noted. In order to evaluate the effect of soil improvement with the help of nanoclay in field conditions, all the tests and geotechnical studies on soil samples located in the channels were performed under valid standards. In this regard, a number of exploratory boreholes were bored in the walls and floors of the considered channel. During this procedure, sampling was carried out in different depths of layers of soil in order for laboratory tests to be carried out and for identification of the soil. The undisturbed samples were also taken by a Shelby Tube Sampler for necessary tests. In order to determine the initial physical and mechanical properties of the used soils, various tests such as particle size analysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity and standard compaction were conducted. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the used soils. Table 1. Soil&#160; specifications Incheberon Area Gonbad&#160;&#160;&#160; Area Soil Properties CL-ML CL-ML Unified soil classification system 2.55 2.54 Particle specific gravity 18 16 Plastic limit (%) 23 22 Liquid&#160; limit (%) 5 6 Plasticity index (%) 86 95 Passing No. 200 sieve (%) 0.04 0.006 Average particle size&#160; (D50) (mm) 16 15 Optimum water content (%) 1.60 1.54 Maximum dry unit weight (g/cm3)  The nano-materials used in this study have comprised nanoclay prepared by Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd with the brand clay montmorillonite K(10). Results and discussion By adding nanoclay to the soil, it is observed that the liquid limit and plasticity limit of samples gradually increases as can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Effect of nanoclay addition on the Atterberg limits test of soil samples Based on the obtained results by adding different amounts of nanoclay to the soil, the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content decreased and increased, respectively. By adding nanoclay to the soil, strain increases at the moment of failure due to increased plasticity and changes in soil structure. It is worthy to note that the unconfined compressive strength in samples stabilized with nanoclay has been increased in comparison with the plain soil.&#160; Plain and improved soil samples were tested with different amounts of nanoclay under unconsolidated undrained conditions at different confining pressures. To study the impact of nanoclay on the collapsibility potential of the soil, double consolidation tests were conducted to determine the deformation of plain and stabilized samples with various amounts of nanoclay under different vertical pressures. The test results showed that adding nanoclay has reduced the collapsibility potential of samples. Conclusions Due to existence of large areas of collapsible soils in Iran, improvement of these soils is necessary in civil projects. With considering the advances of nanotechnology sciences, in this research aiming to understand the impacts of different amounts of nanoclay on above mentioned soils have been studied. The soil samples used in experiments were collected from Golestan province including Boston dam of Gonbad and Incheboron near Gorgan city. In order to assessment of geotechnical behavior of soils, samples were mixed with varying percentages of nanoclay and different tests such as Atterberg limits, standard compaction, unconfined compressive strength, unconsolidated undrained triaxial and double consolidation were conducted. The results showed that nanoclay particles have a significant effect on the plasticity and strength behavior of used soils. Also, it was found that collapsibility index of soils decrease with adding nanoclay and it depends on the type of soil.&#160; Keywords: Nanoclay,&#8206;&#8207; Collapsibility, Improvement, Fine-grained Soils. &#160; 1.

title = {Reconstruction of a Large Scale Sand Specimen Using a Sand Curtain Rainer System}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/6.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 277-298) Introduction Preparation of uniform and repeatable reconstituted sand specimens of required density is a prerequisite for obtaining reliable results from experimental studies. Among different methods of reconstituted specimens, sand pluviation technique is widely adopted by researchers because of its unique advantage. In this study, a new curtain traveling rainer (CTR) is developed for large model sand bed preparation in experimental studies. CTR is a simple and low-cost system which is worked on the principle of air pluviation of sand. It provides specimens with wide range of relative density of sand bed (viz, 30%-90%) and very high degree of spatial uniformity of density distribution while reducing the time of preparation the specimens. A series of laboratory tests is carried out in order to study the performance of the proposed system and the effect of the curtain speed, curtain width, height of the fall and flow rate on the relative density and uniformity of sand specimens. For the sand used in the present study, it was observed that the relative density increases with an increase in the curtain speed and height of the fall. Furthermore, increasing the curtain width results in reducing the relative density. Material and Methods The calibration of geotechnical in situ tests in granular soil requires the preparation of large, uniform, and replicable specimens of a desired density. When preparing calibration chamber specimens, the adoption of techniques such as chemical impregnation and the freezing method in order to obtain undisturbed granular specimens becomes unfeasible due to the technical limitations and relatively high expense of these techniques. Conversely, the pluviation method has been widely used because of its ability to simulate the depositional mechanism of the soil and because of its applicability to a wide range of specimens, from small specimens for triaxial tests to large specimens for calibration chamber tests.&#160; soil sample was chosen from natural white-yellow silica sand mines of Firouzkooh, which can be categorized as poorly graded sand (SP) based on unified classification system (USCS). In order to control sand flow rate at the end of the pluviation path, a series of plates is designed to have rectangular openings with a width range of 2 to 4.5 mm. It should be noted that a sand reservoir is included in the transformer, which enables a uniform sand flow over the rectangular opening. the raining height is set at 100 mm to 500 mm with 100 mm steps. For more accuracy an extra test with&#160; height fall equal 150 mm is performed. A contiguous system of wheel-rail is operated for effective transmission of the traveling funnel over the entire sample surface in the circular container. The device&#8217;s jacking system and its related components are the cause of several limitations, which lead to the implementation of two-joint methods for keeping the sand rain height constant during the pluviation and sample preparation process. Results and discussion The CTR system comprises sand transfer compartments from the main hopper to the sample container and a rectangular opening at the bottom of the hopper, which controls the pluviation flow rate. The main concept driver of this research is to reproduce large samples in the most efficient time.&#160; In order to recognize the uniformity of the reconstituted specimen in the vertical and horizontal directions, the variation of density is evaluated by placing 20 cylindrical molds within the specimen. In this paper the effect of deposition intensity and the effect of height and flow rate on the sample relative density are evaluated. Calibration of the sample preparatory device is very important in order to produce optional and repeatable samples with a specified relative density, in experimental studies and laboratory models. According to the test results, the effects of drop height and flow rate are investigated. Calibration graphs are presented in Figs. 1 and Fig. 2 for the proposed system in the case of 2.5 cm and 5 cm layer thickness. Conclusion This paper aims to extend the existing apparatus to achieve consistent low and high relative density sand samples. The preparation of low relative density samples is particularly important in liquefaction studies in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The comprehensive design and calibration of the CTR system can be concluded in the following points. The proposed method can easily be deployed to produce any arbitrary sample with a wide range of relative densities. Increasing the flow rate given a constant drop height leads to decrease in the relative density and is independent of layer thickness. Keeping constant the drop height and flow rate, higher relative densities can be achieved by increasing the curtain traveling velocity. There is a direct relationship between drop height and relative density. The&#160; results&#160; give&#160; some&#160; information&#160; about&#160; the&#160; deposition&#160; process&#160; and&#160; in particular about the terminal falling height. It can be henceforth stated that the performance of the proposed system is reliable and very acceptable due to high uniformity across the entire sample.&#160; &#160;},

title = {Permeability of Sand with Bentonite Slurry}, 
abstract ={./files/site1/files/7.pdfExtended Abstract (Paper pages 299-318) Introduction Bentonite has been used industrially in various construction projects. This material is used, due to its limited hydraulic conductivity, in some cases such as landfill, sealing walls and nuclear waste disposal tanks. Recently, many researchers have investigated the use of bentonite slurry systems for injection into granular soils under static and dynamic loading conditions in order to improve soil engineering performance. In this condition, bentonite slurry is deposited in a loose soil with low pressure and without disturbance in the structure of the soil under injection. Due to the nature of the thixotropy of the bentonite slurry, the injected material is deposited in the form of gel structures in the soil and leads to increasing soil resistance to static and dynamic loads. For suitable soil engineering properties in granular soil, the use of concentrated bentonite slurry is appropriate; high concentrations will limit the penetration of bentonite due to low soil permeability. In order to overcome this limitation, slurry rheological properties such as viscosity must be corrected in order to increase the depth of sand penetration. Other researchers observed that with the reduction of viscosity in the cement slurry with micro-size particles, the amount of its penetration in the sand column significantly increased. In present paper, due to the lack of studies on the penetration rate of bentonite in sand and also the effective role of bentonite in the mechanical properties of sandy soils, the permeability of sandy soils by bentonite under the influence of change factors such as concentration of bentonite in injection suspension were investigated. Material and Methods In the present study, Firoozkooh sand samples with the traditional names of 131, D11 and D1 were used for testing. Different concentrations of bentonite slurry which is used in this study are 3, 5 and 7% of the bentonite to water ratio. Figure 1 shows the location of the reading of the penetration length and Figure 2 shows variations in the length of infiltration against time for different heights of the pressure head. Figure 1. The reading point of the penetration length in the sample Figure 3 shows the variations of penetration length versus pressure heads for samples with a relative density of 70% at concentrations of bentonite slurry of 3, 5 and 7% in different aggregates. It can be stated that while the concentration of bentonite to water increases, the longitudinal penetration of the injected substance into the sample is reduced. For example, in sand 131 with Dr=70% the penetration value at a pressure head of 130 cm for suspension containing 3% bentonite slurry is 100 cm. The same values for samples containing 5% and 7% bentonite are 45 and 20 cm respectively. This is due to the increase in the presence of bentonite slurry (solid substance) in the suspension. The greater amount of solids inside the suspension causes the greater contact between sand grains with solid particles of suspensions. As a result, it causes increasing friction for longitudinal motion. Therefore, with increasing the concentration of suspension the length of its movement in the soil is reduced. Also, due to the increased viscosity of the injectable substance with increasing the amount of bentonite, the forward movement of the suspension under constant pressure is reduced. This is another important parameter that leads to a reduction in the length of the injection by increasing the concentration of the bentonite slurry. &#160;It is also observed that the variation of penetration in higher concentrations is less than the low concentration. For example, in sand D1 (coarse sand) at a pressure height of 100 cm, the penetration rate at a concentration of 5% increases by 35% compared to a concentration of 3% and at a concentration of 7% increases by 300% compared to the sample containing 3% bentonite. This indicates that at less than 5% concentration the presence of bentonite in the sample is less effective, and the suspension can be more easily move between the pores. This result indicates that by reducing the pores inside the sand, the effect of changing to the suspension concentration is reduced.&#160; Figure 3. Penetration length versus pressure level for specimens with a Dr=70% in concentrations of bentonite of 3, 5 and 7% in different aggregates; a) fine sand (sand 131); b) moderate sand (sand D11); c) coarse sand (sand D1) &#160;},

abstract ={Earth-fill dams stability in steady state seepage condition is very important, especially during earthquakes. Numerical software analyses require accurate and realistic modeling of construction stages. Since earth-fill dams are constructed in different layers, so these conditions should be considered in software modeling to achieve a reasonable design. In this study, an earth-fill dam is modeled in PLAXIS software and the effects of the number and shape of layers are studied in dry and steady-state conditions. Obtained results in static and pseudo-static analyses show that modeling of earth-fill dams with different layers has significant effects on shear stresses and horizontal displacements. For example, horizontal displacements and shear stresses, increase at least 50% and 17% respectively, in comparison with single layer models. According to the obtained results, it can be mentioned that modeling of an earth-fill dam in the layered model and rather in inclined layers are more reasonable},

abstract ={Geotechnical engineers, in many cases face with low strength or high swelling potential of clayey soils. Stabilization methods are used to improve the mechanical properties of this type of soils. Lime and cement are the most popular materials used in chemical stabilization of clayey soils. If sulphate exists in the stabilized clayey soil with lime, or if soil is exposed to sulphates, problems such as strength reduction and swelling increase will occur. Reuse of industrial residual such as Rice Husk Ash (RHA) can be beneficial from the economy point of view. RHA includes a proper amount of silica with high specific surface area which is very suitable for activating the reaction between the soil and lime. In this paper, chemical stabilization of gypsum clays using lime and RHA is addressed&#160;Sulphates exist in the constitution of the soil. Unconfined compression strength and swelling potentials of the stabilized soil are evaluated. The results of this study indicate that RHA has positive impacts on improving mechanical properties of the gypsum clays stabilized with lime. From the view point of strength and swelling characteristics, and economy, addition of 6&#8211;8% lime and 8-10% RHA as an optimum amount is recommended.},

title = {Seismic Active Earth Pressure of Narrow Geosynthetic-Reinforced Backfill on Rigid Facing}, 
abstract ={In the narrow geosynthetic-reinforced retaining walls a stable rear wall exists in a short distance and so there is no enough space to extend appropriate length of reinforcements. In this case, the probability of overturning of retaining wall increases especially when subjected to earthquake loading. To increase the stability of the wall, reinforcements may be connected to the stable rear surface. Alternative solution is the utilization of full-height cast in-place concrete facing in order to resist the earth pressure by combined actions of reinforcements pullout capacity and facing flexural rigidity. One of the main questions about this type of walls is the portion of earth pressure resisted by the facing. In this study, the seismic earth pressure of narrow geosynthetic-reinforced backfill on rigid facing was evaluated using limit equilibrium approach and horizontal slices method. The critical failure surface was assumed to extend linearly from the wall toe to the rear surface and then moves&#160;along the interface of the backfill and rear surface up to the backfill surface. The effects of various parameters such as wall aspect ratio have been investigated. The obtained results show that the applied soil pressure on wall facing will be increased with depth in the upper part of the wall according to the Mononobe-Okabe equation, but its pattern is inversed in the lower part of the wall and it decreases until it reaches to zero at the wall toe. The results of analyses indicate that the attracted soil thrust by the facing increases with lessening of backfill width.},

title = {Deformation and strength anisotropy of calcareous slates under Brazilian tests}, 
abstract ={Rock anisotropy plays an important role in engineering behavior of rocks. Slates are anisotropic rocks which have long been used for gable roof, floor tiles, borrow materials, and other purposes. The slates studied in this research are calcareous and have a porphyro-lepidoblastic texture. To determine the role of the anisotropy on the tensile strength and fracture pattern, two variables including &#968; (the core axis angle to foliation) and &#946; (the angle between the axis of loading and foliation) in the Brazilian tests were used. The angles were selected at 15&#176; intervals. Thus, for both &#968; and &#946;, seven angles of 0˚, 15˚, 30˚, 45˚, 60˚, 75˚, and 90˚ were selected (i.e., there are 43 possible modes). In order to name and examine the failure pattern, 11 models were proposed. The average value of the failure strength for the three stations varies from 3.21 MPa to 20.94 MPa. Based on the obtained results, there is a direct relation between the average tensile strength and density. A comparison between Brazilian test data under dry and saturation conditions shows that the saturated Brazilian tensile strength is 30.8% less than the dry Brazilian tensile strength. Moreover, the changes in fracture length with the&#160;changes in &#968; and &#946; indicate an inverse relation. Eventually, the average of tensile strength (&#963;t) and strength anisotropy index (Ia) demonstrates that the influence of orientation angle (&#968;) is much larger than that of foliation-loading angle (&#946;). &#160;},

title = {Correlations between Spectral Parameters of Earthquakes and Damage Intensity in Different RC Frames}, 
abstract ={In recent decades many researchers have studied on the damage assessment of structures after a seismic event. To assess the damage of structures under an earthquake, it is so important to study the correlations between earthquake parameters and damages of the structures. A lot of seismic parameters have been defined by researchers to characterize an earthquake. Spectral parameters of an earthquake convey a variety of information about ground motion, so they can properly characterize an earthquake. Also a lot of damage indices were proposed by researchers to quantify the damage of the structures or to rank their vulnerability relative to each other. Park-Ang index is one of the best indices to describe the damage of a structure. In this paper, the correlations between spectral parameters of earthquakes and Park-Ang indices are studied. Three RC frames with different height are analyzed under far-fault earthquake records&#160;by nonlinear dynamic analyses. The correlations between spectral parameters and Park-Ang indices of the frames are calculated. The results show that in all the frames most of spectral parameters have strong correlations with damage intensity. In order to estimate the damage potential of an earthquake, some spectral parameters which have high correlations with damage intensity can be proper indices. Housner intensity, acceleration spectrum intensity and velocity spectrum intensity are shown to have strong correlations with damage intensity. In this paper, a new spectral parameter which has high correlation with damage intensity is achieved.&#160;},

title = {The new empirical formula to estimate the uniaxial compressive strength of limestone; south west of Tehran-Iran, as a case study}, 
abstract ={In many rock engineering projects, accurate identification of rock strength properties is very important. Uniaxial compressive strength is one of the most important features to describe the resistive behavior of rocks which is used as an important parameter in the design of structures especially underground openings. Determination of this parameter using direct methods, including uniaxial compressive strength tests is costly and time-consuming, and also sometimes preparation of standard samples in many rocks is difficult. In such cases, the implementation of some simple and non-destructive tests and using empirical relations can increase the evaluation speed and reduce costs. These relations even regional or local (For example within a geological formation or a single lithology) can help in the estimation of these parameters in order to be used in geotechnical projects. In this study, samples of existing limestones in south west of Tehran (Capital of Iran) were prepared and uniaxial compressive strength, point load, Schmidt hammer and Shear wave velocity tests on which have been performed. Then by the statistical evaluations of the results, the empirical relations between uniaxial compressive strength and the results of other tests are obtained. The comparison between the predicted and observed values of uniaxial compressive strength represents the validity of obtained empirical relations. The application of the proposed relations for limestones in the study area and those with similar geological conditions will provide acceptable results.},

title = {Evaluation of the unconfined compressive strength in solidification and stabilization of a phenol-contaminated soil using ordinary and organophilic clays}, 
abstract ={Introduction One of the most important 1-ring aromatic organic pollutants is phenol and its related compounds. These compounds are classified as hazardous wastes base on U.S.EPA primary contaminates list. The phenolic compounds are very poisonous and these are harmful for human health and also for other biota. To control the movement of such hazardous organic waste in a contaminated soil, solidification/stabilization (S/S) process can be an effective alternative.&#160; Due to the negative impact of organic compounds on the cement hydration, the cement-based S/S may be not effective for controlling the movement of such pollutants. To avoid these effects, using some additives during solidification period has been recommended. One of the proposed of such compounds is organophilic clay that is the modified montmorillonite by quaternary ammonium salts (QAS). There are several researches to evaluate the organophilic clay effect on adsorption and stabilization of organic compounds during S/S process. The effectivity of S/S process can be examined by several tests such as leaching test, durability, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), etc. In this study, efficiency of ordinary and organophilic clay was evaluated in the solidification and stabilization process based on unconfined compressive strength of a phenol-contaminated soil. Material and methods In this study, an artificially phenol contaminated sand was considered to evaluate the effectivity of the white cement based S/S process by using two different additives of ordinary and organophilic clay. The contaminated sand contains 2000 ppm of phenol. S/S process was conducted on 14 samples with different amounts of white cement (15 and 30 wt%) as binder and ordinary/organophilic clay (0, 8, 15, and 30 wt % for each of them) as the additives. Two zero percent additive samples are considered as control samples. All samples were cured for 28 days and then UCS test was conducted for all of them. Results and discussion Unconfined compressive strength of all examined samples were ranged from 2226 to 6999 KPa. In the samples with equal amount of cement, th higher UCS values can be observed in blank samples (without any additives and phenol). By adding phenol in the examined sand, UCS of the solidified sample reduces 3 -3.5%.Moreover, results showed that UCS was reduced by increasing the amount of clays. The reduction of the samples containing organophilic clay was higher than samples containing ordinary clay. Unconfined compressive strength values of all samples met the minimum standards indicated by France, Netherlands, Britain and America for disposal in a sanitary landfill. The sample with 30% white cement and 8% bentonite was the maximum amount of UCS (4856 KPa) and the sample with 15% white cement and 30% organophilic clay was the minimum one (2226 KPa). In this study, the average cost of organophilic clay-based solidified samples was 2.3 to 2.8 times more than the average cost of the bentonite-based solidified samples. Conclusion In this study, the strength of the cement-based solidified samples contaminated by phenol was investigated. The summary of the findings of the research is as follows: 1. By adding the phenol to pure sand, the UCS of the samples can be reduced 3-3.5 %. 2. Addition of organophilic clay reduces the UCS of the samples more than the ordinary clay (bentonite) in the same amount. 3. All samples met the recommended UCS level for the S/S process. The minimum UCS level is for the sample with 15% of cement and 30% of organophilic clay. The cost of S/S process is between 23 and 650 $/ton of contaminated soil depending on the amount of used additives and binder. The samples containing organophilic clay has a higher cost than the similar sample containing ordinary clay. 4. To evaluate the S/S process effectivity, a leaching test of phenol (such as TCLP) is recommended &#160;./files/site1/files/0Extended_Abstract2.pdf},

title = {Bioavailability and Concentration of Heavy Metals in Soils and Plants near Irankuh mine Tailing Dams}, 
abstract ={Introduction Exploitation or processing of ores is usually associated with the production of a large amount of waste materials. These materials often have a high concentration of metals which can enter the environment through weathering or erosion. It is well-known that the measurement of the total concentration of metals cannot be an adequate for evaluating the pollution status of soil. Therefore, in most studies on soil contamination, bioavailability content of metals is determined by which can predicate the fate of the metals entering into the other parts of the environment such as plants, water or human food chain. The bioavailability of metals in the soil environment is the exchangeable and absorbable metals for plants, which depends on their exchangeability and absorption by soil organisms especially plants. This is also the function of the chemical form of each element in the soil.&#160; The main purpose of the present study was to measure the total concentrations along with the bioavailable content of metals in soils and plants around the Irankuh mine tailing dams. Area of study The Irankuh lead and zinc mine is located 20 kilometers southwest of Isfahan. This mine is of MVT type Pb-Zn deposit which occurred mainly in limestone and dolostone of lower cretaceous age. The Irankuh mine is an open-pit mine with annual extraction of 358 thousand of PbO and ZnO. The exploitation of mine is also associated with the production of a large amount of waste material which is piled in open dumps around the mine. The main minerals of ores are galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Materials and methods 31 sampling sites were selected randomly for collecting agricultural soils around the tailing dams. Each soil sample is actually composite sample of four samples which are taken from a depth of 15 to 20 cm. Seven cultivated plants (Ocimum basilicum) were sampled from green houses in the vicinity of tailing dams. After drying and sieving, about 50g of the soils are chemically analyzed in order to determine the total concentration of the metals by the ICP-OES method.&#160; Plant samples after drying were changed to ash in the furnace at temperature &#62; 500 C. The concentrations of metals (Zn, Pb and Cd) were then measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrometers in their stem, roots and leaves. pH samples of soil were also determined using the EPA 9045 method. Walkley and Black method were used to measure the amount of organic matter. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil samples was also determined based on EPA 9087 method. Soil texture determined using hydrometric method and then classified according to USDA classification. Diethylene Triamine Pentaacetic Acid (DTPA) extractable metals (bioavailable content) were determined using the method by Lindsay and Norvell (1978) and their concentrations in the DTPA extracts were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The metal transfer from soil to plant was calculated using the transfer factor (TF: metal content in plant divided by metal content in soil). Results and discussion The soil pH of the studied samples varies from 7.36 to 8.35. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil samples was estimated to be in the range of 4 to 22.2 Meq/100 g. Also, the amount of organic matter in the studied soil samples varies from 0.17 to 3.43%. The relative high levels of soil organic matter are probably due to addition of organic manure to soil through agricultural activity. The total concentration of these three matls are significantly higher than their corresponding values in the crust implying that the mining activity and tailing dams greatly elevated the concentration of these metals in soils. Statistically, there is a significant positive correlation among Zn, Pb and Cd (at confidence level of 0.01) indicating that their potential source is the same or having similar geochemical behavior in the soil. The soil clay content showed a significant correlation at the level of 0.05 with Zn, Cd and Pb. This indicates that clay fraction plays a significant role in absorption of these metals in soil. According to the results of single extraction (DTPA method), the proportion of available content for Cd is higher than that of Zn and Pb. Cadmium is often characterized by its high mobility in soil media. Based on the correlation coefficients at the confidence level of 0.01, it is also observed that the increase in total concentration of Cd increased its bioavailability content in the soil consequently increase the availability of other elements in the soil. Therefore, it can be inferred that the availability of Cd in the soils of the study area is likely to be increased in the presence of Zn and Pb because in sites where the total concentration of Pb and Zn is high, the content of Cd availability has also elevated. Based on the comparison of the average concentration of the metals in different parts of the plants, the concentration of metals is ordered as follows stem&#62; leaf&#62; root, which indicates the high root capacity for the accumulation of metals. The average transfer factor (TF) for Cd is obtained much higher than those of Zn and Pb. There is also a negative significantly correlation between the concentrations of Cd in the aerial parts of the plants and its bioavailability concentration in the soil. Also, there is positive and significant correlation between Zn and Cd for all three different parts and its bioavailability concentration in the soil. In the case of Pb, a significant correlation is observed between stem and root parts. This means that Cd and Zn after being absorbed by the root, are more likely being uptake by the plants due to high mobility of zinc. However due to less mobility of Pb, it is seemingly entered into the plant aerial parts after absorption by the root. &#160; Conclusion The concentration and degree of contamination of the studied soils is very high in terms of total Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in agricultural soils around the Irankuh mine. The increased heavy metal contents in soils can be attributed to mining activity and tailing dams near cultivated lands. The measurement of the bioavailable content of these metals indicates that the Cd has the highest availability as compared to Zn and Pb. The average concentration of Pb and Cd in different parts of plant which is higher than the permissible limits, implying that the transfer of the available metal part (especially Cd) from the contaminated soil into the plant. Based on the calculated health risk assessment index in this study, it can generally be concluded that the gradual accumulation of these metals, especially in aerial parts of basil might have health hazards for local consumers. &#160;&#160;./files/site1/files/0Extended_Abstract3.pdf},

title = {Landslide Hazard Mapping Using Dempster-Shafer Theory- A Case Study: Ziarat Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran}, 
abstract ={Introduction Landslides are natural events that one or more factors can effect in its occurrence that each of them plays a special role in this field. The hazard assessments of this phenomenon are a complicated problem due to the interference of the effective factors in its occurrence. The uncertainty that is due to ambiguous conditions of geology characteristics, hydrology, tectonics, land cover, rain, erosion, temperature fluctuations in the slope instability demonstrate the benefit of accurate methods in the study of slope instability. Since the prediction of the landslide occurrence is out of the power of current knowledge, identifying sensitive areas to landslide and ranking it can protect us from landslide dangers. According to preliminary estimates, annually 140 million dollar financial damages inflict by landslides over the country, while the loss of unrecoverable natural resources is not counted. In general, the ultimate goal of studying landslides can be found the ways that to reduce damages caused by them. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the landslide hazard map. The main goal of this research is landslide hazard zonation of Ziarat watershed using Dempster-Shafer. For this purpose, 13 modeling approach (using all factors and eliminating of individual factors) to prepare the hazard maps have used. Ultimately, the accuracy of the model has been evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The study area is one of the most prone areas to the landslide in the Golestan region. Sensitive lithology units, high diversity of topography and land-use changes have increased landslide susceptibility in this area. Therefore, investigation of effective factors in landslide occurrence and providing zonation maps to take management action in this area is necessary. Material and methods The study area is located in northern Iran, Golestan province. The Ziyarat watershed with an area of about 7800 hectares lies between longitudes 54&#186; 10ʹ 13ʺE and 54&#186; 23ʹ 55ʺE, and latitudes of 36&#186; 36ʹ 58ʺN and 36&#186; 46ʹ 11ʺN. At first, extensive field observations of the study area and aerial photos in 1:25000 scales have been used. So, a total of 50 sliding points are recognized and inventory map is produced (dependent variables). Then, 70% of total points (35 points) have considered for hazard zonation maps and 30% (15 points) for model validation. In this research, twelve factors affecting (independent variables) landslide occurrence to provide hazard maps were applied. These factors include land-use, soil texture, geology, rainfall, slope, aspect, altitude, distance from faults, roads and rivers, stream power index (SPI) and plan curvature (CP). These factors can be divided into three broad categories which are topographical, geological and environmental conditioning parameters. The maps of these 12 factors have been produced using basis maps (DEM and Geology maps) in GIS software. The amount of Landslide density in each factor class have calculated from a combination of independent and dependent variables, and rating of classes have done based on Dempster-Shafer equations. Finally, the Landslide hazard zoning map has drawn from the summation of weighting maps in Arc GIS with 13 approaches. In this map, Value of each pixel is calculated by summing weight of all factors in that pixel. The pixel values are categorized based on natural breaks classifier into very low, low, medium, high and very high hazard zones. Then, an accuracy of zoning map has been evaluated by ROC. Results and discussion The result of effecting factors on landslide classification shows that Mobarak formation, forest and agriculture land use, areas with low distance from road and rivers, low altitudes, rainfall buffer of 550-650 mm, northwest aspect, clay-loam soil texture, areas with high stream power index, high slope amplitude and area with fault density lower than 2 km/km2 contain the most susceptibility to landslide. The result of model validation using ROC demonstrates that with eliminating lithology factor Dempster-Shafer model with 92.9% accuracy is located in the great class. Also, the model accuracy shows that with eliminating rain and altitude factors the model accuracy is decreased to 73.8% and 80.4%, respectively. So, these two factors were identified as the most effective factors in the occurrence of the landslide in the studied area. Based on the landslide zoning hazard map of the Ziarat watershed and landslide points (15 points) that are considered for model validation the 20, 40, 26.67, 13.33 and zero percent of landslides is situated in the very high, high, moderate, low and very low hazard classes. Conclusion In this research, susceptible areas to landslide in the Ziarat watershed have been mapped with the Dempster-Shafer model. For this purpose, 13 modeling approach to prepare the hazard maps have been used. The following conclusions are obtained from this study. - The rain and altitude factors were identified as the most effective factors in the occurrence of landslide in the Ziarat watershed. - Based on the landslide zoning hazard map of the Ziarat watershed 60 percent of landslides is situated in the very high to high hazard classes. - The produced landslide hazard map is useful for planners and engineers to reorganize the areas which are susceptible for landslide hazard, and offer appropriate methods for hazard reduction and management. ./files/site1/files/0Extended_Abstract4.pdf&#160;},

abstract ={&#160;Introduction Recently, several studies on buried pipelines have been conducted to determine their uplift behavior as a function of burial depth, type of soil, and degree of compaction, using mathematical, numerical and experimental modeling. One of the geosynthetics applications is the construction of a reinforced soil foundation to increase the bearing capacity of shallow spread footings.

abstract ={Introduction Determination of in situ stress-direction and magnitude are prerequisite for any oil well drilling and oil field development such as hydraulic fracturing. One of the simplest and most widely used methods is called borehole breakout analysis. Breakouts are compression fractures made in the direction of minimum horizontal in situ stress (Sh), if drilling mud pressure be lower than optimum mud pressure. Some borehole imaging logs such as FMI, FMS and UBI are appropriate tools for wellbore fracture detection. These fractures are distinguished in the logs as dark and symmetrical points (or lines) on both sides of the well and are used as an indicator for in situ stress studies. The size and shape of these fractures are strongly depend on the magnitude of the in situ stress. Therefore, many researchers suggested that by analyzing the geometric shape of the borehole breakout is an appropriate technique for estimation of in situ stress components. ....&#160;./files/site1/files/0Extended_Abstract7.pdf &#160;},
