Urban environmental problems, providing public and security services, green space and city façade, urban economic problems, informing, research and training makes the urban management duties list every day longer. Tehran Metropolis as the most important and greatest city of Iran and one of the most important metropolises of Middle East and included in the 20 great cities in the world, face these challenges more and less. Doubtless, management in this city with a population of 8 million peoples and 2/3 million families residing therein in an area equal to 800 square km, is not possible without participation of citizens. Citizens&amp;rsquo participation in their city and neighborhood matters, firstly has frequent benefits for municipality. If citizens based on their well-known motto &amp;ldquoour city, our home&amp;rdquo are sensitive to the city matters and public profits, then plenty of municipality responsibilities will be fulfilled in a better manner. Therefore, quality of assistance to the growth of organizational model of urban NGOs&amp;rsquo participation has been converted to an important phenomenon and one of the most essential questions. The experience of participation of NGOs in the developed societiesindicated that solving many urban problems such as urban environment, inappropriate status of security, unsuitable city façade and improper urban economic status is possible only at the extensive presence of NGOs and upon active participation and responsibility in the urban services management.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
