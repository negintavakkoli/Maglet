(Case Study: NIOPDC)}, 
abstract ={This study investigates the relationship between cultural intelligence and social capital. Since social capital is one of the most valuable assets of an organization and considered to have a critical role in corporate competitive advantage, reviewing its components seems necessary. Unfortunately in Iran, a country with variety of different cultures, the concept of cultural intelligence is still immature and most of people mistakenly consider cultural intelligence only as cultural differences. In this study we examine the relation between social capital and cultural intelligence as two important elements of human resource studies for the first time. To do so we have chosen staff of NIOPDC (National Iranian Oil Production Distribution Company) as our sample population .Results from different surveys in this company show that there is a positive and meaningful relationship between main variables of the study, Social Capital and Cultural Intelligence. This meaningful relation could be an appropriate guidance for human resource manageress and also can help strategists to find best solutions to improve staff cultural intelligence in such organizations and enjoy the accumulation of social capital as the result.},

Strategic innovation is about changing business models, creating markets without competition and a big surge of value proposition to customers.Learning processes entails explorative, assimilative, transformative, and exploitative processes. Through evaluating of our hypotheses, we came to the conclusion that Learning processes affect strategic innovation; exploitative learning is the only part of learning processes with no effect on strategic innovation. Also, combinative capabilities mediates the relationship between learning processes and strategic innovation. Research centers of Iran&#8217;s oil industry was the case study of this research},

The theory of dynamic capabilities has been presented over the past two decades as a supplemental resource-based view to help us understand how to develop resources of an organization over the time and how to maintain a competitive advantage. In this article we have tried to present a conceptual model of&#160; the most impressive capabilities related to the resources re-configuration of dynamic capabilities that have significant impact on improving construction companies performance. Research models using data collected from 97 construction companies in the PLS software were analyzed. The results based on the structural equation modeling method reveals that learning capability as one dimension of internal resources re-configuration&#160; has the most&#160; impact on performance of construction companies.},

title = {Defining Structural Model of Human Resource Management in Project-Based Organizations: New Trend Based on HR Quadriad}, 
abstract ={Human resource management is a collective act carried out by several players within project based organization. Typically in a project based organization, four players play the major role in management of human resources: project worker, line manager, project manager and HR specialists, which dysfunction in the HR organization can be explained by the weak interplay between two or more of these players. On the other hand, HRM practices have been changed based on projecetification and types of project- based work setting. Therefore, since the project- based organization is the main focus of this paper, firstly a clear definition of these kind of organizations is given. Then, the HR structure and organization in project-based organization and different types of project-based work setting explained. Later on, with discerning the HR structure and the role of all players in HR quadriad, and by means of objective data analysis related to limit and participation of RIPI project workers, the roles of HR players in RIPI determined and based on that, the structural model of HRM at RIPI designed for the first time in Iran. This paper also concludes some strategic guidelines and suggestions for the establishment of HRM in project based organizations in Iran.},

abstract ={&#160; The current research was conducted to present a model for training transfer in Tehran oil Refinery Company. Descriptive research method was adopted. Whole employees take apart with 360 people and the sample size by using the chart Kerejesy- Morgan included 186 members. In order to collect the data, Holton standard questionnaires (2000) as well as Salorenzo training transfer questionnaire (2004) were distributed among personnel's of operation unit by using simple random sampling technique. Descriptive and deductive statistical methods were applied for the analysis of the collected data using SPSS and lisrel. The results of the research demonstrated that the transfer of training has been favorable and in the medium level. There was a meaningful relationship among personal factors, educational factors and organizational factor with training transfer. In this research there was no meaningful relationship between self-efficacy, negative personal results, and supervisor's prevention with educational transfer. The most important effecting factors on training transfer were the educational factors with 0/69 path coefficient and then the organizational factors with 0/45 path coefficient and personal factors with 0/24 path coefficient, in order. Among educational factors, the most effective factor in educational courses has been the feedback. Also among organizational factors, the most important factor was the expectations from the functional results, and among personal factors; the most important variable was the capacity for the transfer. Finally the structural model of the effective factors on educational transfer was designed},

As oil projects are always subject to risks and hazards, developing human resources is an important function HR development programs must be based on real and immediate needs. This study aims at providing a model for developing staff in Iranian complex projects (case study of POGC). Hence, based on multi-methods approach, three strategies have been used to answer the research questions namely document analysis, Delphi technique, and benchmarking. To validate research findings, two techniques were used entitled member check and peer debriefing. Based on the findings, the overall HR development strategy at POGC owns a linear nature which comes in contrast with the company complex projects. Hence, the prescribed model is based on needs assessment from various perspectives (goal based and failure based), flexible and systematic instructional design, individual development plan, and goal based and performance based evaluation.},
