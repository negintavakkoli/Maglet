Negative effects (such as over-recruitment and crowding in companies, rising costs of human resources, etc.) have caused a crisis in some energy companies. The purpose of this study was to present a model for crisis management in oil companies' human resources system. The research method was descriptive survey and the statistical sample consisted of 200 managers and experts of the National Iranian Oil Company. Statistical software was also used to analyze the results. The results showed that except for one index (identifying the probable events) all of the mentioned indicators of the model can be prescribed for human resource crisis management strategies in oil companies. The highest mean score is related to the index &#34;Developing Human Resources Management Policies and Measures to Promote Motivation, Job Satisfaction and Commitment of Employees&#34; and the next indicator is the priorities of implementing training courses for empowerment.},

abstract ={&#160;The main purpose of this study was to provide a model for the expectations and priorities of human resources in National Iranian Oil Company by QFD for quality engineering of welfare system. The research method was qualitative and quantitative. At first, welfare indices were extracted from Delphi method and interviews with experts (n = 15) and then these indices were matched with the needs of human resources (n = 208) as a questionnaire. In the present study, the statistical sample in the qualitative section were the experts of the Oil Company's welfare department whose issues, such as time, availability of the interviewees, and the extent of their cooperation were considered. 15 people. After preparing the final questionnaire of expert indices in the quantitative part the number of questionnaires was obtained by Cochran formula. Reliability was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha of greater than 0.7 and validity test was performed by examining factor loadings and AVE scores. To ensure the quality of the home matrix (HOQ), technical requirements were created and the welfare service quality plans were processed to build the quality home matrix.

This study was designed to provide a model for human capital development. The research is applied and descriptive in terms of data collection. This was a descriptive-descriptive survey research using a semi-structured questionnaire and interview. In the first stage, an open questionnaire was prepared to identify the human capital development status in Iran Ministry of Petroleum of Iran. Then, a second questionnaire was designed to extract the relationships between variables, to determine the weighting coefficients of the indices and to present the mathematical model of the research.The statistical population was the experts from Ministry of Petroleum of Iran and based on the specific conditions, a number of its experts were selected as statistical sample. Systems dynamics approach was used to design the model. By using Vensim software, scenario writing was done. Finally, six scenarios were considered and among them &#34;Improvement of training and development software programs&#34; was identified as the strongest scenario and the &#34;Improvement of staffing capability&#34; was selected as the most attractive scenario. According to the results, the Ministry of Petroleum must first empower its staff to develop its human capital. Since empowerment is both objective and subjective, therefore, employees' mental capacity and self-esteem must be enhanced by increasing their skill level and empirical ability to achieve an acceptable level of productivity.},

title = {Analytical Comparison of Business Network and Business Ecosystem}, 
abstract ={Emergence of the new concepts in business field of study beside of increasing environmental changes has made it more complex. The continuous changes, shows the importance of theoretical and practical readiness in relation to environmental issues. Two topics that have got attention of both academics and practitioners are &#8220;Business Network&#8221; and &#8220;Business Ecosystem&#8221;. This paper tries to scrutinize the concepts in order to delimitate them and considers outcomes of moving to and shaping business ecosystem. Therefore, Science direct, Emerald Insight and Google Scholar documents in period of 2000 to 2019 is extracted. 54 Documents are identified. In order to analyze, main concepts are extracted and verified by panel of experts. Coding is the method of analysis. Finally, findings are categorized in structural, mental and relative dimensions. Two concepts have many similarities in terms of structural and mental dimensions but from relative point of view there are significant differences. One of the most important outcomes of shaping business ecosystem is the change of innovation model from conservative and imitative to absorptive innovation.},

abstract ={This study aimed to identify the cognitive differences between expert and novice managers in the performance of their main tasks by examining their perspectives and experiences. To do so, two four-people groups of experts and novice managers, from two subsidiaries of National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company were selected. A task analysis interview was conducted for every participant and the data was encoded by Crandall, Klein, and Hoffman&#8217;s (2006) guideline and the two groups were compared together. The results revealed various cognitive differences between the two groups. Most importantly, expert managers considered probabilities, obtained the approval of others for their decisions, and paid attention to the importance of workforce. These cognitive differences can help organizations hire qualified managers, identify weaknesses in the performance of managers, and train managers.},
