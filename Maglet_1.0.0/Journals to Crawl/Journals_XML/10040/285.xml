				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The main purpose of this study is to describe gender differences in body image and to explore the influences of some socio-psychosocial factors on it. The study has been conducted via survey method and data has been collected by self-administered questionnaire. The present statistical society was all students of the University of Mazandaran in 2010. Overall, 360 students were selected through availability sampling as the final research sample. Descriptive results of the study show a significant gender difference in the body image satisfaction, that is to say that women or men are more dissatisfied bodily.
Moreover, analytical results indicate that; such variables as appearance orientation (body investment), body embarrassment, body surveillance and self esteem variables could significantly presuppose the level of body satisfaction among total sample. However a substantial gender difference has been witnessed in influencing body shame variable. In other words body shame variable, in addition to body investment and self esteem- as components of self objectification variable- are predicting factors of body satisfaction among women (and not men), illustrating the severe effects of social expectations from ideal body of the females and internalization of them compared to men. Furthermore, there is a gender difference in the level of body investment, signifying that young females compared to males, report greater investment on their bodies and engage in extensive grooming behaviors. Finally, students with a sense of self esteem had greater sense of satisfaction over their body image.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the main agreements among classical and contemporary sociologists is putting emphasis on the role and place of utilizing forms of capital in reconsidering identity limits and expansion of collective belongings. This article is based on conceptual framework (Jenekins and  Bourdieu) and tries to study empirically the theory of the relationship between the amount of economic capital as well as of social  and cultural enjoyment and the sense of belonging, commitment and loyalty of women towards tribal and national identities. In order to study the above mentioned relationship I have used a sample group of 375 women aged 18 to 45 living in Sanandaj. The method used was survey and the data were collected by using a questionnaire which had already been checked for reliability and validity. 
The Research results indicate that a positive and negative correlation between cultural and social capital and the salience of the national and ethnic identities are respectively a positive correlation between economical capital and the various types of collective identities. Yet, the highest degree of correlation is with national identity. Also, the correlation between the various types of collective identity and the objectified and embodied dimensions of cultural capital is to some extent different from that with the institutionalized dimension. Among aspects of social capital, civic and institutional relations carries influential and strengthening effect on national identity and in sum explain 59 and 37 percent of variations of the national and ethnic identity among the women under study.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The present study tries to find out the role and procedure of gender attitudes in genesis of women’s body image among women under cosmetic surgery in Shiraz. Research method in this investigation has been qualitative through grounded theory. Based on purposive sampling 24 women who had the experience of cosmetic surgery during the year 2008 in Shiraz were selected for an in depth interview. To achieve the grounded theory during coding analysis, 36 concepts, 9sub categories, 3 essential categories and 1 core category named: “Women’s own body image overshadowed by implicit, preponderant, appearance oriented views of men towards women in different ways” were extracted. The results show that women’s body image is formed through their gender attitude towards themselves, men towards women and women towards men. However the attitude of women toward themselves is inspired by the attitude of men toward looks and appearance of women. 
Advancements in science of beauty surgeries has had the role of facilitator in paying more attention to the body and looks and has assisted men with their appearance based view towards women.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Women’s homemaking activities involve a variety of jobs including taking care of children and family. Despite the fact that these activities encompass economic, social and cultural values, they are not generally considered and the economic place of homemaking activities in the society has been ignored. In other words, a major part of women? s activities in areas of upbringing children and homemaking that take place at home are not counted.
The main aim of this research is to calculate the surplus value of the  activities of  homemaking  and  to study  the effective social factors  on  added  values of  women’s  indoor activities. Accordingly the weekly calculation of the surplus value of Tehran women’s homemaking activities estimates at 1600000 Rials.
Questionnaire and a random multi-stage sampling were the tools used in this survey. After filing the final questionnaires by 2000 homemaker women of Tehran, the gathered related data were coded and analyzed by means of SPSS software. The result of research show that three variables including "woman’s age", "woman’s education" and "family size" have meaningful impacts on explaining the surplus value of women's indoor activities. Among the mentioned variables the “family size” or the number of family members had the most impact on the changes in surplus value of homemaking activities.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Consequences of divorce, specially the negative ones, affect different sectors of society generally and become specifically important in gender development analysis and social policy, because of their especial influence on women’s lives. This article reviews the previous studies and published literature on after-effects of divorce in Iran in a period between 1997 and 2011. Based on an initial search, 197 texts were gathered and after preliminary evaluation and screening, the content of 23 of them were extracted and analyzed. Finally the analysis was organized and evaluated in the following levels: 1- general features, 2- aims and queries of the research, 3- methodology of the research, 4- types of variables and 5- findings as well as outcomes of the research.
Findings of this study show that in general, divorce not only damages human and economic resources, but a gender-sensitive analysis also shows that it could be an obstacle in women’s participation in development and finally leads to their marginalization and exploitation. This study also demonstrates that female researchers pay more attention to psychological and economic impacts of divorce rather than social problems and drug addiction.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The results show that men’s and women’s access to an amount of a resource such as income and education can augment the authority of each of them in the family. The increase of the belief of gender oriented ideology in women leads in male authority increase in the family. Also women's participation in family finance will add to the authority of them in the family.]]></dcterms:abstract>
