There is a need to improve urban transport networks, to use transport potential efficiently on the basis of environmental logistics and to improve environmental safety as one of the principles of sustainable transport development. The systems model to create an ecologically safe logistics system of public transport determines the relationship between input parameters (transport system indicators) , output parameters (ecological and economic indicators of the route network) and controlling parameters, restrictions, uncontrolled parameters and environmental impact assessment. To model the route network, linear programming (a transport task) has been used as a method with the criteria for optimizing the indicators of economic, ecological and social assessment. A target function is an additive function indicating economic costs, environmental and social losses in passenger and / or freight transportation with weight ratios. It describes the cost of the logistics system. The weight ratios of the importance of economic and ecological indicators are chosen for each route depending on the specifics of transportation. It enables to choose the scheme of transportation by the integration index. (Optimal or compromise plan is suggested according to economic or ecological indicators). The developed approach has been applied to improve the route network of public transport in Kyiv based on ecological and economic principles. Network optimization of only three routes has enabled to increase the income and reduce expenses for passenger transportation. Meanwhile, harmful emissions - CO, CmHn, NOx, PM, СO۲ - have also decreased.</field></doc></add>
