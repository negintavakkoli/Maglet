Since this technique is implemented in a large part of the activities of the petroleum industry research center, this study addresses this issue. This research has been conducted with a applied-development approach, utilizing the expert group's view of mathematical modeling of selecting contractors at the oil industry research institute with the Bernardo model. The results showed that the research institute of petroleum industry in evaluating contractors should use a two-stage model. Also, from the viewpoint of the expert group in the first phase of selection, the number of selective criteria increases, the final utility rate is reduced in the expert group agreement, but this in the second phase of the selection reflects precisely the results of the photograph. Based on the results of this research, suggestions were managed to increase the satisfaction of contractors and stakeholders in this industry.</field></doc></add>
