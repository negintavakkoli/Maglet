Since social capital is one of the most valuable assets of an organization and considered to have a critical role in corporate competitive advantage, reviewing its components seems necessary. Unfortunately in Iran, a country with variety of different cultures, the concept of cultural intelligence is still immature and most of people mistakenly consider cultural intelligence only as cultural differences. In this study we examine the relation between social capital and cultural intelligence as two important elements of human resource studies for the first time. To do so we have chosen staff of NIOPDC (National Iranian Oil Production Distribution Company) as our sample population. Results from different surveys in this company show that there is a positive and meaningful relationship between main variables of the study, Social Capital and Cultural Intelligence. This meaningful relation could be an appropriate guidance for human resource manageress and also can help strategists to find best solutions to improve staff cultural intelligence in such organizations and enjoy the accumulation of social capital as the result.</field></doc></add>
