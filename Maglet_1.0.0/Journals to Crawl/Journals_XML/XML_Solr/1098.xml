This research has descriptive-analytical approach and tries to recognize and rank the rate of existing services in ۱۳ neighborhoods of Noorabad Mamsani City in Fars Province using education, health, and cultur, sport, office, green space, and facility indexes. For this purpose, initially the prosperity of services in these areas was examined by using models of the coefficient of variation and statistical techniques and then, the rate of prosperity of urban services in these neighborhoods was evaluated and analyzed by using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model based on TOPSIS approach. The results show that there are significant discrepancies regarding the rate of prosperity of services among ۱۳ neighborhoods of Noorabad so that central areas of the city i. e. neighborhoods ۱ and ۲ in district ۲, are prosperous and nomadic areas are prosper less. Eventually, there is imbalance and inequality among different areas in this city regarding concentration of population and access in terms of spatial distribution of services.</field></doc></add>
