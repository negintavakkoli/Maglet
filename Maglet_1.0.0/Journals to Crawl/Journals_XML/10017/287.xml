				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Sense and respond logistics is taken as an adaptable logistics to the environment; it is also aimed to identify the requirements of its environment and is capable of adapting to the requirements. This study is an applied one and also descriptive-analytic in terms of purpose and data collection procedures. The study was an attempt to propose a model for the development of electronic logistics in the ground force of the Iranian army through utilizing sense and respond approach. For this purpose, the effective factors affecting the electronic logistics in military organizations were emerged and identified as a result of content analysis. Moreover, in a bid to provide a general model for explaining the relations among variables, this study was also conducted through utilizing interpretive structural modeling in military setting affiliated to the ground force of the Iranian army. ISM is identified as a technique of decision making and system analysis through utilizing the elites and experts opinions and consultation. This study was also conducted through engaging sample population of 13 elites and experts affiliated to the electronic logistics centers of the ground force of the Iranian army. The findings revealed that three main components of Sense and respond approach including stability; speed and flexibility are effectively affecting the military electronic logistics centers. Additionally, the crucial effects of electronic logistics components also including infrastructure of information technology, cargo tracking technology, well-timed production and distribution as well as capacity and ease of transportation. In this study, structural-descriptive equations were also run to evaluate the impacts and the effectiveness of factors. Finally, MICMAC analysis was also run to evaluate the driving power, correlation and the dependencies among factors.  ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Given the crucial place of huge expenditure on advanced branched-based military courses in military organizations, this study was an attempt to evaluate the efficiency of advanced branch- based military courses in the air force of the army of Islamic Republic of Iran. In a bid to enhance the effectiveness of these courses, some practical suggestions are also made in this study. As an applied and descriptive field study, this study was conducted through engaging sample population of 339 university professors, students and commanders affiliated to the Esfahan advanced branch- based military training centers and also Shahid Sattari university of Iranian army who were selected based on simple random sampling. This study was also run through administering a questionnaire among statistical population. To analyze the data, the statistical analysis including variance analysis, one way Anowa, one sample t test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis H and Friedman test were also run in this study. The findings revealed that in terms of effectiveness of advanced branch-based military courses, all trainings, learning and reactions proved less than expected level and the obtained results are not significant in theses courses. Finally, the advanced branch-based military courses were evaluated moderate in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and implementation of these courses are highly beneficial to military organizations.]]></dcterms:abstract>

As an applied and descriptive field study and also in an attempt to assess the knowledge management level of Imam Ali military university, the study used a researcher-made questionnaire to collect the required data and its validity was assured via expert consultation while the reliability was estimated using Cronbach Alpha method releasing 91%. Moreover, both descriptive and inferential statistics including one sample t test and Friedman test were also run in this study. The findings of the questionnaire and expert consultation revealed that in terms of knowledge management dimensions, situation of Imam Ali military university is not acceptable and is far from an ideal situation. Additionally, among KM dimensions and components, the utilization of knowledge enjoyed the significance and stood at top of ranking while the other components were ranked orderly including knowledge assessment, knowledge sharing, knowledge getting, improving and expanding the knowledge as well as maintaining the knowledge.  ]]></dcterms:abstract>
