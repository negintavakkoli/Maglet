	<abstract_fa>One of the changes brought up by the Internet both in Iran and in the other parts of the world is internet-based marriage. The present study aimed to explore Isfahani women experiences of the cultural consequences of internet-based marriage. To this end, a qualitative-phenomenological research design was used. The participants in the research sample were 12 women who became familiar with their husband via the internet and married them. The participants were selected through purposeful sampling using snowball method. Besides, the data were collected through in-depth interviews and were analyzed usingColaizzi method of analysis. Accordingly, a number of 140 significant codes were extracted. Then, a number of themes were elicited and negative and positive cultural consequences were recognized in terms of values, norms, customs, and family. The participants’ experiences of cultural consequences of internet-based marriage included concepts such as mistrust, the reinforcement of emotional relations, reduced biases, the concealment of type of marriage, disbelief in traditional marriage, the lost of family connections and influences, and poor consultation in family. </abstract_fa>
