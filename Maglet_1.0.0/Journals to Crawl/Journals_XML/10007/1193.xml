	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Urban spaces and in other words urban design and architecture have been found with close linkage with art and beauty especially the arts such as &lt;em&gt;painting and sculpture&lt;/em&gt;. Addressing beauty at different areas such as creation of galleries to offer works of art, addressing form of urban spaces and representing works of art in urban environment have improved social life and increased identity, consensus and collective solidarity. On the other hand, it can provide an interesting and calm environment for the citizens and residents. Concurrent with the socio-political developments in the twentieth century and the progress of science and technology, all the areas of the arts were subjected to change. The metamorphosis of the art and stylistic developments took place and a large number of artists tended to innovative phenomena. Since the art at the twentieth century especially the second half of the twentieth century sought to affect the &lt;em&gt;addressee&lt;/em&gt;, a group of the contemporary artists including sculptors have not known the &lt;em&gt;tight enclosure of museums and galleries to represent their works and preferred to display their works at open space and wide and large places of cities. Representing works at open space requires largeness of dimensions of works at multiple scale and use of modern materials and techniques. Sol Lewitt (1928 - 2007) has been regarded among the artists at contemporary age at the area of Minimalism and Conceptual Art. &lt;/em&gt;American philosopher and theorist and contemporary art critic, Arthur Coleman Danto, has conducted articles in criticism to works by &lt;em&gt;Sol Lewitt and has appeared in &lt;/em&gt;exhibition of his works. Lewitt made the earliest structures in 1965 and continued his activity at the 1970s by expansion of plans and planning for the larger projects which have been being made based on &lt;em&gt;morphological&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and conceptual ideas. Ultimately his arrangements were proposed at huge scale and extended from the space of galleries and museums which tended to conceptual and minimalist art to the urban space. In the present research, works of this artist and ideas of Arthur C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Danto about minimalism and works of Sol Lewitt are analyzed. The main questions are as follow: What outcome representation of these works has in natural environment and urban space? how the border between art has removed the daily life and addressee? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
