This research has a descriptive &#8211; analytic essence, which it sets to the application of Goal Programming model for optimal allocation of construction budget of Isfahan Municipality. It has been tried to identify the most important construction budget&#8217;s constraints, Non-priority sectors in the allocation of construction budget, model goals and the impact of subsections of construction budget in achieving the objectives of CDS and checking out the achievement of CDS objectives with current budget management method. The target society includes all the staffs of Isfahan Municipality and 11 of them have been selected for the sample size in non&#8211;random manner. In order to analyze the values in years 2011 to 2014, Goal Programming model was used. Some of the required data were collected by using the questionnaire and some of them were extracted from the Municipality documents. According to the model stipulated in three forms, the results of the most complete model indicated that because of the lack of appropriate models for planning the credits and relying on the bargaining power, the allocation of the construction budget was not optimal in any years and the given values to variables do not achieve the goals mentioned in the CDS, and the credits in some subsections were considered more or less than enough, and goal programming model will be a useful tool in determining the optimal values in future years.</abstract>

Despite the great deal of attention to training and its programs, accomplished studies suggest that many of these programs do not have required effectiveness in terms of learning transfer and transmission of learned skills to the workplace, as an important effective indicators of training programs, have done very little and the rate of the obtained capital return on investment is very low for them. So, awareness of predisposing or obstacle factors of learning transfer to the workplace and consequently investment return in human resources for organizations are of great importance specially for banks and municipalities. Therefore, models and current studies regarding the learning transfer were investigated in this research and an effective model of learning transfer was presented parallel with return on investment in human resources development&#160;emphasising on urban management. The results showed that major factors of learning transfer from training environment to the workplace include individual and organizational factors. Individual ones are those influencing on the knowledge use and acquired skill from training environment in workplace and include motivation, attitude, self-efficacy and personality characteristics. Organizational factors are those related to the workplace and they influence on learning transfer and its use of whatsoever learned during training courses and they include support, responsiveness, job career, organizational climate and individual results.</abstract>
