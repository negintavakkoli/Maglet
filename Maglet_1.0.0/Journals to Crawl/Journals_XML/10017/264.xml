			<abstract>E – government is the most controversial issues standing second the Industrial revolution as it is identified as a powerful instrument as to improving internal efficiency of governments, quality improvement in service rendering and encouraging public participation. As the biggest organization in each state, government covers many other bigger organizations. Development of E – government can facilitate   inter-sectoral relations and achievement of society objectives.
It seems that technical–legal barriers ahead of E–government development have caused Iran remain in the list of third world states. under development of E – government has had likely consequences such as deficiencies in  implementing coordinated democracy with the people&#039;s needs and also failure in decentralization of power and reorganization of servicing.
As an applied and analytic study, this research aims at measuring the effectiveness of parameters improving technical - legal infrastructures of developing E – government in Iran, ranking their and finally offering solutions to the development of it in Iran.
Dematel technique was employed to determine the effective and affected parameters. The data analysis show that &quot;organizational capacity&quot; and &quot;open political- democratic atmosphere&quot; should be given priority in the fields of technical and legal – legislative, respectively, so that, the process of E-  government development in Iran can be facilitated .</abstract>

Wide spread skill needs of knowledge – based or IT– based societies along with the sustainment of traditional training system fail to be met thereby. To this end, this study was an attempt to identify factors affecting satisfaction of web-based virtual training users based on Kano&#039;s model. Then, a conceptual model of the factors based on two models including experimental and general ones was implemented among  the users in two virtual–training universities in Tehran, selected randomly factors such as training variables human specifications, user mediator, infrastructure, Content and interaction. chi – square analysis of the ideas of  71 students collected  through a &quot;Likert&quot; scale scored and already validated questionnaire via SPSS revealed that&quot; user mediator  and interaction&quot; has had the highest effect on their   dissatisfaction. </abstract>

			<abstract>In the era of wisdom in which knowledge is identified as the most important capital of every organization and society, knowledge management is the main function of organization intending to act as learner organizations.
Many of the organizations willing to survive and protect their competitive situation follow knowledge management approach. Success of this approach depends on the fact that various organizational parameters including structure and culture can enjoy certain characteristics and be cohesive and coordinated. Existence of gap and lack of coordination between these factors prevent implementation of knowledge management. The study focused on two key variables: &#039;&#039;organizational structure&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;organizational culture&#039;&#039; in relation to knowledge management and &#039;&#039;knowledge creation&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;knowledge transfer&#039;&#039; as two key activities of knowledge management. Methodologically, the study is descriptive and field in nature and in order to collect the data, questionnaire and library materials were used. The participants were selected from among the commanders, managers and professors of the university holding at least BA or BS degrees.
The findings revealed significant relationship between the variables. Then organization should be looked at as a system and totality of the factors should be taken into account. Analysis of organizational factors in terms of requirement in relation to knowledge management is the first and most important measure which can have a strong ground for further studies.</abstract>

			<abstract>Research findings support important role of artificial intelligence in the success and efficiency of organizations. Similarly, research shows that dutifulness is one of the variables affecting management and commanding. Preliminary studies sustain higher correlation between dutifulness and emotional quotation. Given the fact that the cadets are appointed to managerial positions in their official service lives, conducting study on the relationship between these two variables can entail practical and effective implications as to their commanding quality.
To this end, Barons&#039; emotional quotation and Neopi-Rs&#039; personality questionnaires were administered among 507 stratified- randomly selected cadets. The data were put into SPSS software and statistical analyses like pearson-product correlation, one–way ANOVA and linear regression were run. The findings sustained significant correlations (p &lt;0.01) between the variables. However, the findings revealed negative correlation between the two variables and years of education. Regression analysis proved, U2 covariance between the two variables and then teaching on E1 can improve the rate of dutifulness to the extent that a cadet with higher E1 level is supposed to be characterized by planning power, highly active, purposeful, and determined and willful.</abstract>
