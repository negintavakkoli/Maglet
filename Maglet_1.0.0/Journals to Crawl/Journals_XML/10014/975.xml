title = {A Review of Organizational Ambidexterity and Performance}, 
abstract ={The success, growth and long-term survival of an organization depend on its ability to exploit current capabilities and simultaneously explore the new competencies. Numerous articles have been devoted to the study of organizational ambidexterity in innovation, organizational and strategic management literature. Some indicated the important role of ambidexterity in organizations' performance. Others brought up that it is not so significant, and this question is yet to be answered. So far, several literature reviews and meta-analysis have been conducted on this construct, which has been focused on limited specific aspects. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of both qualitative and quantitative studies which include all types of performance and also highlight the different conceptualization of organizational ambidexterity. Therefore, this comprehensive systematic review of 134 qualitative and quantitative studies during 1991-2016 has pursued two major goals: First identifying different conceptualizations of exploration and exploitation, and second, identifying the causes of different effects of organizational ambidexterity on performance in previous studies. The review results found 15 different conceptualizations of exploration&#8211;exploitation; and also six reasons for the different results of previous research on the impact of organizational ambidexterity on performance have been identified, including measurement of organizational ambidexterity, level of analysis, research design, implementing organizational ambidexterity, performance measurement, and organizational ambidexterity conceptualization, each with its own dimensions},

title = {Relationship between Organizational Silence &#38; Leadership Style Regarding the Moderating Role of Personality}, 
abstract ={Although the employees are expected to contribute in organizations development by utilizing their knowledge, ideas, and comments, so often they prefer to remain silent. This research was designed to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between organizational silence and leadership style at Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). In this practical study, we gathered descriptive data by questionnaire, and utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to look at the correlations among data points. The random sampling technique has been used to gather 115 data points among the target population of 350 employees at RIPI. It has been used a combination of Leadership Style questionnaire (Bass &#38; Avilio, 2000), Personality questionnaire (L.R. Goldberg, 1993), and Organizational Silence (M. Vakola and D. Bouradas, 2005) for gathering data. Reliability and validity of data were investigated by using the cronbach's alpha test and AVE test, respectively. The results indicated that the transformational and transactional leadership style has a significant reverse relationship with the organizational silence, while the relationship between non-interventional leadership style and organizational silence was insignificant. Furthermore, the introvert personality has a significant direct relationship with organizational silence. The results showed that for the staff with introvert personality, the non-interventional leadership style amplifies their silence and vice-versa. The personality variable in transformational and transactional leadership style has a moderating effect on the leadership-silence relationship as well.},

Using Cochran formula, 248 of them were selected as statistical sample by simple random sampling method. SPSS and Amos software were used to analyze the data. Based on the results of the structural equation analysis, all the hypotheses have been confirmed. The hypothesis based on this fact that &#34;organizational citizenship behavior has a significant effect on job performance&#34;, with the coefficient of 0.77, has shown the highest path coefficient. The second hypothesis, based on the fact that &#34;understanding social responsibility of staff has significant effect on affective commitment&#34; with the coefficient of 0.65 has shown the least path coefficient. The results showed that the employees should be socially responsible for increasing their job performance. On the other hand, the social responsibility of employees by affecting the quality of employee's work life, effective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior also make changes in job performance.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;},
