<Abstract>This study tended to provide a comprehensive and systematic model for SHRD based on the CIIP model. To this mean, a targeted review of the definitions, frameworks and models of (SHRD) was carried out. The research method was qualitative meta-synthesis. For data collection, secondary data sources called previous documents were explored. The method of data analysis was a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The study population consisted of all the articles on the SURD topic, published in ISI journals, books and foreign dissertations between the years 1989-2017. Based on the CIIP framework, researchers recognized several subcategories for each of the four categories of &#34;context&#34;, &#34;input&#34;, &#34;process&#34;, and &#34;product&#34; mentioned in various foreign studies, repeatedly. As a result, a final integrated model was presented and validated on the basis of these categories and relevant subcategories. This metamodel is applicable to HRD professionals to help them determine which &#34;contexts&#34; and &#34;inputs&#34; are required to consider before a successful implementation of strategic human resource development, to help them determine the required &#8220;processes&#8221; and &#8220;mechanisms&#8221; during implementation, and to help them determine the final products.</Abstract>
