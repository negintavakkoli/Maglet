Spatial inequalities are among the major problems the development of which has changed the spatial structure of the cities. The continuity of spatial inequalities and the decrease in life quality in some small-sized urban districts and the ineffectuality of the current methods necessitate opting for different but feasible methods in urban planning and management. The current study aims at emphasizing the life-quality decrease in the districts with spatial inequalities requiring analysis, interpretation, and putting forward a specific structure to help detect the reasons for the appearance of unequal structure wherein life quality has decreased, the threats and problems, and the opportunities which have avoiding traditional approaches to planning and management in small-sized urban districts in consequence. To this end, one of the small-sized districts of the city of Tehran, which suffers from spatial inequality and the decrease in life-quality, was selected and the preconditions for running planning and managing in it were pointed out. It goes without saying that devising a proper plan to moderate or eliminate the inequalities, together with the increase in public cooperation in urban management, and utilizing multidimensional concept about life quality in urban planning, distinct from the common methods, are among the major objectives of the study resulting in equality and the realization of justice in the cities.</field></doc></add>
