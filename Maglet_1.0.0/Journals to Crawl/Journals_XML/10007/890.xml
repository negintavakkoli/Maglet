	<abstract language="eng">
 Today, modern organizations are complex and
vast enough not to be able to be managed by a single manager, therefore he is
obliged to get the assistance of the others to manage the organization properly
considering the limitations of every personâ€™s mind. This article, applying the
survey method, studies the concepts of participation and participatory
decision-making, and the solutions and advantages of application of these
concepts, specifically in municipality of Neka. Sample Society are randomly
selected from among all employees of municipality of Neka. Data are gathered
through questionnaires, mostly closed ones. Validity and reliability of the
questionnaires and their contents are accessed via spss and getting
consultations from expert professors. Many methods such as variance, t test,
regression, and Pearson are applied for data analysis. Results proved all of
the hypotheses on the existence of meaningful relationship between
participation of employees and their efficiency. However, there are no meaningful
deviation among employees based on their gender, while they differ from each
other considering their literacy and work experience. </abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">When a natural disaster occurs, cities are affected series of connected systems. In other words not only the city elements are being affected by disasters but also they influence the other city elements in a systematic interaction. The more the influence and impaction city element, the more the numbers and types of the other elements affected from that. The matter has an extreme importance on the assessment of damage of elements and to city itself, totally. In Iran there are about 873 small cities with the population less than 20000. There is no rule or plan defined for crisis management of small cities and it remains as gap in disaster management programs in such cities and there are no special criteria. Considering the relatively high number of small cities and noting that disaster management programs are established for large cities, this research is conducted on the basis of available documentation, literature review studies and expert opinion in vulnerability assessment and related criteria for small cities against natural disasters. After recognizing the proper criteria, a survey is formed by experts about confirmation and categorizing the criteria for Gilan-e-Gharb city in west of Iran. The research process done based on AHP using EXPERT CHOICE software, expertâ€™s judgment. After statistical data analysis the importance coefficient and weights of criteria of vulnerability for5 city districts are derived and compared so the districts of the city are ranked based on their vulnerability to natural disaster. City fabric, Density, structural robustness, hazards exposure, availability of disaster management measures are some important factors in this regard. The results can be used in a proper risk reduction plan of the city against natural hazards.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">After enactment of Directing Subsidies Act, public institutions like municipalities confronted with new challenges and problems. As with the most of the discussions between experts went to evaluation of impacts of this Act on people, there is less attention has drawn to its impact on public institutions. In this article, we studied the challenges confronting municipalities as a public institution aftermath of Directing Subsidies. Municipalities are institutions that serve citizens in different ways and so, any change or challenge there may lead to increase or decrease of citizens' satisfaction. In this research, first, we gathered needed data about Kerman Municipality through focus group, and then, analyzed through thematic analysis by help of Atlas.Ti software solution. Finally, we developed a conceptual model of challenges confronting Kerman Municipality based on gathered data.  Conceptual model shows that, with certain themes in mind such as: change in dynamism of effective elements on municipality functions, effects of enactment on municipality functions, and ultimate effects on citizens risks and costs of municipality operations have increased and occupational certainty of municipality employees has decreased which may finally lead to a decrease in services and welfare of Kerman citizens

	<abstract language="eng">
Cities have changed a lot over the time. Today, the rapid growth of urban population has made these changes faster and faced cities with opportunities such as increase in economic growth rate, increase in efficiency, and increase in opportunities of scale and with challenges such as increase in urban poverty, deepening of inequality, and lack of infrastructures. Use of these opportunities and encountering the difficulties need to apply proper and effective urban planning methods. City development strategy (CDS( is one of the urban planning methods introduced by Cities Alliance for this purpose. City development strategy is one of the latest urban planning methods. This strategy has four main foundations and livability, as one of its foundations, focuses on increasing citizens' quality of life and access to equal opportunities. In this study the livability level of Isfahan was evaluated using field method and through asking Isfahan citizens' ideas. In order to improve the livability level of Isfahan and decrease the existing difference between its zones in terms of livability, the following suggestions are provided: As â€œcitizen participation in the city affairsâ€� has been the poorest dimension of livability in Isfahan, it is suggested that the municipality of Isfahan should increase its degree of interaction with citizens and through asking their ideas and criticisms should try to improve the livability of the city.

	<abstract language="eng">
Deteriorated urban areas are mainly those parts of the city where their functionality have declined due to deterioration of the content, which cause a set of problems and difficulties. Urban renovation and improvement plays an essential role in the survival of a city, sustainable development and the necessary livelihood requirement of the citizens, which are some of the important responsibilities of the governments. The renovation projects of deteriorated urban areas are complex and multi-disciplinary programs, which are implemented for improvement and development of the urban areas from physical, social, economical, and other aspects. Such projects include various stakeholders and vast recourses, moreover their dependency on a large number of factors and variables make them potentially high risk projects with many uncertainty. Considering these features, in this research common risk in renovation projects of deteriorated urban areas are identified and assessed. As a case study the neighborhood renovation projects of the Tehran renovation organization is chosen. According to the research methodology, after a literature review, the characteristics of the projects were identified. Analyzing this information, by expert interview and questionnaire method, 45 risk factors were identified and analyzed.. In the next step, by applying qualitative risk assessment of the identified risks, top ten risks of  the renovation projects are identified, these are: management changes and decrease in the effectiveness and durability of decisions and plans, failure or delay in implementation of the related infrastructure projects, failure or delay in land acquisition of the projects, lack of coordination between projects bodies (external organizational interaction), lack of participation of the responsible organizations (renovation practitioners), considering their commitments, delay in approving legal documents needed for renovation of deteriorated urban areas, delay in receiving fund from the government and city council, legal problems related to project's land ownership, lack of public participation in neighborhood renovation process and failure or delay in implementing of value added projects (stimulating development projects). In the observation of top ten risks it is found that the highest risks mostly occur in the external environment, within the scope of projectâ€™s external stakeholders.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the methodology and process of interpreting the members in Urban Changing Committee (Committee Article 5) on the requests of stakeholders and developers.  Members of UCC apply different methods for interpretation especially hermeneutic in similarity with relevant professions and situation in process of analyzing the requests however those reforming actions go to bureaucratic achievement on the urban development plans as regards deficiencies of methodological and procedural in the process. Methodology of this research is observation and content analysis as qualitative method with phenomenological hermeneutic approach to interpret the deducting process in interaction of members with request as text. Findings of research identified that some factors influences on the process of interpretation, decision making and decision taking in UCC including style of the request, manner of the presentation, stakeholders and developers condition, and inner anarchy of committee. Additionally, this paper identified that there is ambiguous in the mind of members of UCC such as analytical process on the requests, pre-understanding and self-understanding in the interpretation process. Results of research explained that UCC have formed in new liberalism government to establish gradually reformation in capitalistic region. Therefore, in this process, all actions adapt with the bureaucratic framework to make plans more governmental. Hence, consensus in this committee constructs on bureaucratic dominating than free-domical participations, consensus in differentiation, or collusion in conflict. Result of this research could apply by local government to revise on the current situation of UCC also by developing countries in the same situation to recognize and solve planning system in atmosphere of conflict among different power groups.

	<abstract language="eng">
Current research wants to achieve for aims of improving residentâ€™s attachment to place scales (home, neighborhood, and city) between historical and modern neighborhoods and decreasing the mobility of residential places. Research methods are qualitative and quantitative with comparative style at three scales between historical (Sorkhab) and modern (Roshdieh) neighborhoods in Tabriz city. Conclusions of research findings indicated that relation between attachment intensity and place scale in city depends to neighborhoods time and place. Relation between place scale and affective dimension of place attachment is curved (U) in historical neighborhoods and inversed (U) in modern neighborhoods. Findings indicated that social factors are affective factors on improving attachment to neighborhood and city at modern neighborhood, and physical factors on decreasing attachment to neighborhood at historical neighborhood. So planners and urban designers to improve residents attachment to historical neighborhoods as basic problem, should take to account to physical factors such as neighborhood feature, green spaces and preservation of surrounding and neighborhood cleaning. Impact of some individual on attachment at historical neighborhood (positive) is inversed at modern neighborhood (negative). Finally, findings indicated that to improving attachment should differently take to account to residentsâ€™ individual characteristics and designing the physical properties at historical â€“ modern neighborhoods.

Citizen Participation or human activeness is one the most important factors for development in a society. Although the most known way of citizen participation is voting, there are some more active ways. In this paper, we firstly define the word â€œcooperationâ€� in some humanistsâ€™ point of view and propose our definition by concluding their ideas. Then we trace the citizen participation goals in sociologistsâ€™ works and choose four main goals included their views. In the next step, we consider the existing practicable methods for active and passive cooperation and introduce Forum Theatre techniques, especially Legislative Theatre, as experienced methods by Augusto Boal. Finally, we suggest Legislative Theatre as an effective practicable method for citizen cooperation which is completely conforms to cooperation goals.

	<abstract language="eng">
Today, the necessity of citizen participation is an undeniable fact in management of cities. Especially in developing countries which are facing with many problems related to planning and implementing of projects, citizen participation can solve many of these difficulties. Participation or non-participation of citizens has several dimensions. Considering the social, cultural and historic features of cities in different countries (and in this perspective, Iran), its complexity becomes more explicit. The purpose of this paper is not review and providing solutions for all the hurdles involved in Iran's citizen non-participation, But intends to introduce a physical context which hosting social and cultural events and increase citizen participation by emphasizing on the meaning and function of City Hall, as a socio-physical element, and also its relationship with social issues such as participation and public space. For this purpose, after reviewing the listed concepts (and their relationship with City Hall) and introduction of two city halls in the world and also a brief mention of the conditions of these spaces in contemporary Tehran and the relationship between citizens and urban management in Tehran, solutions in order to create such atmosphere, but not necessarily as city Hall, will be presented.

Chaos and irregularity in the city's streets had conscious and unconscious negative effects on citizens' psychological perception. Nowadays the managers, specialists and citizens have accepted that the streets appearance is in need for improvement. However, the problem is the way of encountering it and the instruments and methods may be applied in this regard. The method and approach that lead to effective actions toward the improvement of the space and anatomy of the cities' appearance, and to provide people whit a two-directional and effective relation with the city anatomy, are in urgent need. In this regard, some studies have been conducted in order to find out the psychological and mental effects of the city body on the citizens.  The study attempted to correlate the structural spaces and human mental aspects in one hand, and to coordinate the bonds among the visual environment and spiritual expectations of the observers on the other hand so that we may present a more favorable environment for the citizens. In this regard, we conducted interviews whit the Mirdamad Street's users for specifying the above mentioned effects. The results showed dissatisfaction, negative consequences including stress, anxiety, fear, none-security and lack of happiness among people.

The high rate of urban population growth in Iran and lack of urban infrastructure, loss of valuable land in the urban area in other hand, the need to review of changes and prediction of urban growth is coming more and more apparent. This research was done to understanding the spatial dynamics and urban growth patterns in Hashtpar city during 1989-2000 and modeling urban sprawl in 2007. Hence using urban changes map corresponding to the logistic regression model during this period to investigating rule of socio-economical and biophysical variables to urban development. After data normalization and analysis of covariance, that variables with correlations of more than 50% were excluded in model. Result showing suitability of modeled cell was increased a round of distance the city, transportation network, hydrographical network, forest, rangeland and slope variables, and reduced in vicinity of agriculture and rangeland. Also results of ROC (0.77) and Pseudo R2 (0.40) analysis showing good relative agreement between simulated and classified map. sensitivity statement of model to stepwise independent variable elimination and comparing results with the full model, reflecting effect of seven different variables on Hashtpar growth was determined Among studied variables, the old core of city and slope was most effective data for urban development in Hashtpar city.

Evaluation of outdoor recreation potential is mean the identify of land capability for outdoor recreation and ecotourism land use. First was identified the suitable areas for intensive and extensive outdoor recreation using five ecological parameters (slope, aspect, height, soil and vegetative cover) and usual method in Sorkhe Hesar forest park. Result showed that 297.223 hectares of park area have class 1 extensive outdoor recreation potential, 86.465223 hectares of park area class 2 extensive outdoor recreations potential, 1.126 hectares of park area class 1 intensive outdoor recreation potential and 137.417 hectares of park area class 2 intensive outdoor recreation potential and 16.212 hectares of park area is protection region. with field surveys to become characterized that one of problems that caused to increase rudeness in park nature is absence of attention to all effective factors (water resources and recreation facilities) in assigning to outdoor recreation potential of park. For this purpose and evaluation of visitor's suitable use from outdoor recreation places, used of questionnaire and verbal interview technique. Coincident with this evaluation, recognized all points concern to water resources and facilities' park and recorded for provision of  the water resources and facilities' map using GPS. In addition to recorded situation all of points that questionnaires was dispensed in them at outdoor recreation classes. Result showed people usage of park, don't conforms to classification plan and outdoor recreation have direct relation with to water resources, facilities and tourism charisma of the park. Therefore these factors as positive informational layers intersected with primary recreation capability map and obtained final recreation capability map based on this factors. Final results showed that usual method despite very efficiency, because don't consideration all effective factors in outdoor recreation need to enter other informational layers (for example water recourses and recreation facilities) in addition to ecological factors.
