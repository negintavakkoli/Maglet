	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;After demonstrating Ottoman Empire and attempt of Turkish emperors in order to gain caliphate and government of all Muslims, World&amp;rsquo;s political geography witnessed the demonstration of great Ottoman Empire for six months. The formation of Ottoman Empire, on one hand, was converted to the main axis of the political geography of the region, and started competing with other political power districts of the world on the other hand. This went on for ages. By the end of the world war first, the world&amp;rsquo;s political formation was altered and the disintegration of the great Ottoman caliphate occurred by Sykes-Picot agreement in 1917 and this led to the beginning of the advent of a new political geography. By getting into power, Turkish Islamists caused a new era in the region&amp;rsquo;s political geography in 2002. New neo- ottoman idea with the aim of changing the political geography of the region is included to be one of the most important political events of the region. In this paper, by having a quick look at the record of Ottoman Empire, we are going to focus on the new strategy of Turkish AKP and inspect the effect of the strategy on changing the political geography of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
