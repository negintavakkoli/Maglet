In order to carry out the project, twenty samples were selected among faculty members and top managers in related fields. Fuzzy Delphi and interpretive structural modeling were used to analyze the data. The findings were led to an integrated model of human resource risks with four levels. Contextual risks as the foundation level and the most influential one and the behavioral risks as the most influenced level of the proposed model were identified. Managers were expected, in order to minimize human resource risks, to be more responsive to the levels of the model.</field></doc></add>
