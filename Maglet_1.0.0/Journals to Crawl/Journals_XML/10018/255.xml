				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Although success of defense industries depends on many factors, innovation is a key factor in transition to a new era of defense industries. Previous studies have mentioned many factors, such as individual, organizational and environmental, as affecting innovation success. Opportunity creation for future wars, responding to army's current needs, and gaining economical profits are 3 main components of innovation success in defense industries. In spite of the fact that all these factors have key roles in innovation success, some researchers emphasize more on the importance of organizational factors. In fact, innovations in defense industries are complex, expensive and require interaction between industries and army. In this situation, organizational capabilities and assets are very important elements for innovations to succeed. In this study, after explaining the dimensions and components of innovation success, organizational factors are identified. Then, with the help of 13 defense experts, we try to refine the factors according to the field. After that, by using survey methods, we study organizational factors impacts on radical and incremental innovation separately. The results show that 22 of 40 factors have meaningful impacts on innovation success, while the ranking and priority of these factors differ in radical and incremental innovation.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The main objective of this study is to provide a model for the formation of emerging technological innovation system in Iran's biotechnology sector. In this study which uses qualitative and quantitative methods, the historical development of the formation of this sector is analyzed, taking the functional approach of Technological Innovation System (TIS) concept. Using historical data mapping, the evolution of different functions and activities is charted in this paper. By conducting factor analysis and structural equation modeling on 103 questionnaires, the functions and activities of the conceptual model are confirmed and the causal relationships between different functions are mapped. Based on the results, 7 functions and several activities are identified for the formation of emerging technological innovation systems in Iran. The results indicate that the government has a key role through influencing the functions, such as directing research and innovation, institutionalization and legalization. Therefore, the government's functions and activities are the main drivers of the formation and development of these sectors in Iran, and also simultaneous development of knowledge and market capacities facilitate the process.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[New product development (NPD) is a modern approach for responding to environmental changes in firms according to critical success factors (CSF), and for achieving competitive advantages. The alignment of technology change management — with concentration on technology acquisition planning and filling technological gap — with new product development process is a necessary. The purpose of this study is to prioritize technology management functions in NPD process by considering CSFs as criteria and concentrating on a knowledge-based organization. In this descriptive and survey study, Fuzzy AHP method is used. Based on the experts' views, 5 technology management functions are identified, and 3 groups of key success factors are used to prioritize them. The results show that the function of identifying and selecting technology in feasibility stage, the function of technology acquisition in technology development stage, and the function of technology exploitation in product development stage have the highest priorities. Accordingly, a design theme for an efficient technology management system in NPD is achieved. The reliability of the study is confirmed by Cronbach's Alpha and its validity is verified by technology management and NPD experts' views.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Why do customers prefer one product/brand to others? Which elements make one product more attractive than others? Nowadays, with the growth of markets, customers are growing too and understanding their behavior becomes accordingly more complicated than ever. "Customer behavior" is one of the most important issues for any marketer in SAIRAN organization to the extent that many decision-makings in the organization depend heavily on that. Hi-tech markets have special environmental characteristics, such as market/technology and competitive uncertainty, which differentiate them from low-tech markets; however, B2B and B2C marketing have many differences. One of the major objectives of this paper is to explore critical factors affecting the decision-making of hi-tech organizational buyers. Focusing on "Patient's Heart Monitor" as a hi-tech product in SAIRAN Company, we propose a new applicable model for the company marketing management. In this study, the "grounded theory method" is used, which is the best approach to find an applicable and useful model for B2B buying behavior in high-tech products. Finally, we compare this model with one of the latest models — i.e. Manabery &amp; Tina's model — to reveal its strengths and weaknesses.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[As a new management concept, business model has been highly emphasized by academics, practitioners and business analysts in the last two decades. Academics use the term "business model" when they want to describe the rationale of value creation and value capture in an organization. Since perspectives on defining business model concept and function is highly diverse, many ambiguities have been arisen regarding the relationship between business model and strategy. To shed light on this issue, the present paper first investigates the business model literature and then reviews different views regarding business model and strategy relationship. After that, a research framework is developed to address business model elements arrangement fit to Porter`s generic strategies in high-tech firms. Also, clustering analysis is used to group firms based on their business models and strategies, and then the performance of the firms is compared to investigate the fit between business model elements and each of the Porter's generic strategies. Finally, the results reveal that the arrangement of business model in firms which follow cost leadership strategy is different from the arrangement of business model in firms which follow differentiation strategy.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The present study seeks to design a pluralistic organizational model in Iranian Aviation Industries Organization through a descriptive survey. The main concern of the study is that the main organizational elements of the current aviation industry are not capable of positive interaction with the pluralistic and paradoxical elements of its external and internal environments. To solve this problem, a survey is performed on the literature, and 54 main values of pluralistic organizations are extracted and then reduced to 8 main values using Delphi technique and 30 academic and industrial experts' opinions. Furthermore, the conceptual model of a pluralistic organization in aviation industry is designed by the interaction of 8 extracted values through Delphi technique. A questionnaire is then designed, and its reliability and validity tested by Cronbach's Alpha and affirmative factor analysis. Moreover, hypothesis testing for 16 hypotheses is performed through route analysis which leads to the approval of the conceptual model. This study indicates that "varied environmental stakeholders", "pluralistic structure", "non-occurrence technology" and "varied human resources" will drive the organization to show pluralistic behaviors, such as horizontal integrating, networking and road-mapping. Also, the results show that such values have strong interaction with each other, while the most related variable in each value is identified too.]]></dcterms:abstract>
