				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study is an applied-developmental and also qualitative research in terms of purpose and data collection procedures. The study was conducted through data-based analysis and grounded theory. This theory is systematic approach and qualitative study in terms of developing theory in which rationality can be elicited in the light of selecting the method of taking advantages of the participants ’point of view as well as investigating them and reaching conclusions on those viewpoints. This study was an attempt to design the pathological model of implementation of public policy in Iran. For this purpose, the study was conducted through administering face to face interviewand posing some questionstaking 30 up to 90 minutes among 20 populations of policy makers, administrators and professors of policy making regarding the obstacles ahead of implementation of public policy making in Iran. The sampling was conducted in terms of theory. At first, the set of primary concepts were collected through encoding process and then some components were emerged as a result. In an axial coding step, the relationship among these components were determined in a coding paradigm and in the selective coding step, each of these components were explained respectively. In terms of comparison, the advantage of this study concerning the pathology of implementation of public policy making is that the presented model is comprehensive and action-based model. This model has worked on the most effective components of unsuccessful implementation of public policy making and also made an attempt to identify the obstacles ahead of it as well as the challenges ahead of implementation of public policy making. Finally, the consequences of unsuccessful implementation of public policy were also explained in this study.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Sense of personnel identity in an organization exerts a powerful influence over the behavior and the attitudes of staff as well as enhancing non-physical martial power of the armed forces. In a bid to overcome the environmental challenges, managers should strengthen the organizational identity of personnel; therefore, understanding the effective factors affecting the Sense of personnel identity in an organization became the important duty of managers. As a causal research, this study aims to investigate the effect of authentic leadership style on organizational identification. For this purpose, the study was conducted through engaging randomly selected populations of 400 personnel affiliated to the defensive-industrial units in Tehran. The reliability and validity of the instrumentations were assured in the early stages and then data analysis was run in terms of structural equation modeling. The findings of the research hypothesis revealed that all dimensions of authentic leadership style are effectively affecting the organizational identification. Finally, some practical suggestions are made by researcher.  ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Risk management is taken as one of the basic requirement in modern armies. In a dynamic and technological environment,identification and prioritization of risks is not feasible unless we implement the scientific and logical processes. As an applied and descriptive field study, this study was an attempt to identify and prioritize the risk affecting the continuity of operations in radar and missile sites as well as electronic identification. This study was conducted in a military center. For this purpose, the study was also conducted through engaging 49 experts and specialist from commanding and management departments of air-defense bases in the provinces of Fars, Bushehr and Khuzestan. The study was also run through administering three types of RFMEA questionnaire for data collection procedures. To analyze the data, both descriptive and inferential statistics were run through SPSS analysis. The William fine technique was run for risk assessment while the error analysis was run to measure the effect of risk failure. The findings revealed that risks of maintenance and manpower management respectively enjoyed the highest potential risks in terms of significance with coefficient of 20, 15 percent. Moreover, the physical security and work safety stood at the lowest potential risks with coefficient of 9 percent. Consequently, possibility of occurrence is among the most important factor affecting the critical risk. Finally, ten components were identified and prioritized as the highest potential risk affecting the continuity of operations in air-defense bases]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[As a damage and casualty-alleviating measure, military site selection is among the key issues for military men and is of crucial significance for the military commanders. Logistic is taken as the most fundamental pillar for every military conflict and also known as the backbone of all warfare. Site selection and concentration are among the most important factors in any logistic designing. High capabilities of geographical information system including high-level of processing and managing the useful information helps planners and commanders in various stages of operational analysis. This study was an attempt to identify the suitable and appropriate sites for deployment of logistic units in front of martial and battlefield prior to any physical intervention by utilizing GIS and fuzzy multi-criteria decision making procedure. To do so, the region was checked in terms of slope, drainage, observation, concealment, soil, land utilities, road, and proximity to maneuvering units, structure, proximity to helicopter landing sites and distance from light artillery units of the enemy. Having collected the data and merging them based on fuzzy system, the fuzzy modeling operations were run in a MATLAB environment through applying the principles. Thereupon final output was obtained through defuzzification process and then run in GIS environment. According to the field assessment, the findings revealed that the foothill zones and areas, mountainous semi-high areas and militarily geomorphologically significance regions have been extracted successfully and it confirmed that the role of GIS and its integration into multi-criteria decision making procedures in running military analysis was effective in reducing expenditure, time and casualties]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study was an investigation of the effective factors affecting the organizational agility of Imam Ali military university from commanders ` point of view in the units of student brigade. To do so, 44 questionnaires were randomly distributed among commanders of student brigade. This study was also run through administering an organizational agility questionnaire for data collection. The questionnaire includes 32 questions and covers seven dimensions including flexibility, accountability, culture of change, integration and complexity, speed, mutual cooperation and managerial functions. To analyze the data, descriptive statistic was run through central and dispersion index and to test research hypothesis, the inferential statistic was run through Pearson correlational coefficient, T test of two independent groups, one-way analysis of variance and SPSS analysis. The reliability of the questionnaire was estimated using Cronbach Alpha method releasing 80% and its validity was assured in terms of content. The findings revealed total mean (4.89) which represented a relatively favorable situation of organizational agility of Imam Ali Military University. The findings also revealed the following effective factors affecting the organizational agility such as the dimension of managerial functions which stood at the highest average of belief indictors including commander’s awareness, Belief in transparency and belief in doing things through systematic ways and networking. Moreover, the dimension of mutual cooperation stood at the second rank of indicators including consultation with the others, increasing the skills and knowledge of commanders through using organizational technologies, having joint multiple capabilities of commanders as well as improving their relationship with soldiers.]]></dcterms:abstract>
