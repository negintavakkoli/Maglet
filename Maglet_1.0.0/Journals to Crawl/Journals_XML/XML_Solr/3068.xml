Fit indices showed that the proposed model was fitted to the data. The other findings with confidence interval of %95 indicated that variables including: trust/respect climate with coefficient of .168, discretionary decision making with coefficient of .397, and performance feedback with coefficient of .193 were positively correlated with self-determination. In addition, discretionary decisions making with coefficient of .333, and performance feedback with coefficient of .215 had a positive correlation with thriving at work. More analyses revealed that thriving at work was correlated with both job performance, with coefficient of .302 and organizational citizenship behaviors, with coefficient of .239.
