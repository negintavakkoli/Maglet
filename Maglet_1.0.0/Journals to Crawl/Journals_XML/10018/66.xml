				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[During last decades a large amount of efforts have been done by emerging economies and developing countries in order to technological catch-up and acquiring essential knowledge and capabilities for manufacturing and development of complex products and systems. As an example, Iran has been doing a lot of efforts in order to acquire essential knowledge, skills and capabilities for manufacturing and developing gas turbines and it achieved pleasant and remarkable results. So, this paper through applying qualitative approach and case study strategy has investigated the successful experience of acquiring knowledge, technological and managerial capabilities of manufacturing industrial gas turbines by Oil Turbo Compressor Company (OTC) during IGT25 project and has identified drivers and factors effective on this successful experience. The evidence illustrate that government policies, supports and initiatives; networking, interaction and cooperating within key players and stakeholders; existence of significant local market and demand; strategy and mode of technology acquisition; organizational and managerial capabilities and contextual and enviornmental factors have played key role in acquiring knowledge and technologies of manufacturing gas turbines by Oil Turbo Compressor Company.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Within about one decade, the growth of technology policy and management academic discipline (TPMAD) in Iran has been faced by some challenges. There is some evidence of heterogeneity within and between some elements of the discipline and there is no vision for development of it. Pursuing interpretative participatory policy analysis perspective, this study aims to explore and structure the problems and solutions of TPMAD development in Iran from the stakeholders’ view. We do this by content analysis and mapping their arguments. The results show 34 core points and 22 policy issues in the arguments, most of them have both educational and research aspects. In half of the issues there is high level of conflict between different views. Less than 30 percent of issues are structural and game changer. Decisions about these issues should be made based on actors’ consensus and supplying adequate facilities. Changes in 70 percent of the issues have chain impacts on the others.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Due to context-dependent nature of EO construct, an exploratory sequential research design was utilized to first develop a new EO measurement scale in public RTIs and then, investigate its effect on performance indices of 15 research centers within these RTIs from universalistic and contingency perspectives (moderating effect of environmental and internal factors). The results indicated that the Entrepreneurial Orientation of research centers has a positive and substantial effect on their financial performance which is being moderated by environmental factors in a way that EO has the strongest relationship with financial performance under unfavorable environmental conditions.]]></dcterms:abstract>
