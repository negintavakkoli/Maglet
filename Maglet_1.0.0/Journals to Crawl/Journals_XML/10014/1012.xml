Considering the increasing role of researchers and their empowerment in developing the competitive advantage of the companies, identifying and analyzing the factors affecting the empowerment of researchers was considered as the main objective of this research. The present study is considered an applied research in terms of its purpose and descriptive, in terms of data-collection is. The survey method has been ued and data collection tool was a questionnaire. The statistical population consisted of researchers at a research center in petroleum industry. By studying the related literature and using the previous researches, 28 factors influencing the empowerment of the researchers were identified and analyzed using factor analysis. Then, the factors influencing the empowerment of the researchers in this center were measured in three groups: occupational factors, organizational factors and individual factors. Then, using factor analysis, factor loading of each index of these factors was calculated. After that, the results were extracted; the status of these factors and their indicators at this center was analyzed. Finally, given the fact that the current situation in all three groups was less than the average, recommendations for conducting corrective actions were proposed to the research executives for future development.

The purpose of this paper was to present the talent supply chain management model of the National Iranian Oil Company. In term of aim, this research is considered an applied and developmental research based on mixed method. The statistic population in qualitative step consisted articles in domstic and foreign scientific information bases related to talent management and in Quantitative step the human resources experts of company. The statistical samples for Meta synthesis included 12 articles related to talent supply chain management, which was determined through a multi-stage refinement of 109 papers and for Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling 22 HRM experts were selected by purposeful and judgmental method. Based on the research findings, talent supply chain network structure, talent supply chain key processes, managerial elements, core functions, talent supply chain performance and talent supply chain strategies are dimensions of the talent supply chain management model. In the presented model, the structure of the talent supply chain network has the highest driving power and the performance of talent supply chain management has the highest dependence degree.
