title = {Crisis Management Model in the Petroleum Firms System}, 
abstract ={In recent decades, energy companies have been thinking about remediation and recruitment of new human resources. The new wave of hiring has had both positive and negative effects. Negative effects (such as over-recruitment and crowding in companies, rising costs of human resources, etc.) have caused a crisis in some energy companies. The purpose of this study was to present a model for crisis management in oil companies' human resources system. The research method was descriptive survey and the statistical sample consisted of 200 managers and experts of the National Iranian Oil Company. Statistical software was also used to analyze the results. The results showed that except for one index (identifying the probable events) all of the mentioned indicators of the model can be prescribed for human resource crisis management strategies in oil companies. The highest mean score is related to the index &#34;Developing Human Resources Management Policies and Measures to Promote Motivation, Job Satisfaction and Commitment of Employees&#34; and the next indicator is the priorities of implementing training courses for empowerment.},

For this purpose, 76 of &#160;key executives that participated in assessment center and 360-degree appraisal selected by available sampling.&#160;Data analyzed by SPSS software and Pearson correlation, linear regression, stepwise regression tests. The results showed 360-degree appraisal scores significantly can predict assessment center scores and dimensions of 360-degree appraisal (supervisors, colleagues, subordinates and individual evaluations) are different in predicting assessment center scores. Also, the construct validity demonstrated weak support for convergent validity of competences. The findings indicate in order to increase validity of competency-based tools such as 360-degree appraisal, design and use of those should as much as possible be accurate and based on scientific evidence.},
