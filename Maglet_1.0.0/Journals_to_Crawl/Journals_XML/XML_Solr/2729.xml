Thus, this research aimed at investigating the relationship between the employees’ trust in managers and organizational silence. Indeed, in this research the effect of employees’ perception of managers’ character that according to Mayer et al, (۱۹۹۵) including: ability, benevolence and integrity, were studied on defensive and acquiescence silence. To cover this aim, the selected sample included ۲۸۲ employees of central branch of National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (N. I. O. P. D. C) and the required data was gathered by a questionnaire and analyzed by Structural Equations Methods. 
Our study showed that increasing the trust of employees in managers reduces the organizational silence of staff. In addition, if the trust in managers increase, the defensive silence reduces, while acquiescence silence increases. According to the results, managers can improve their recognition of the silence environment in organizations which can lead to the change in behavior and increasing trust in managers resulting in not only creating positive employees' perception of managers’ character but also, the willingness to share knowledge, experience and information. Finally, this can increase organizational performance.</field></doc></add>
