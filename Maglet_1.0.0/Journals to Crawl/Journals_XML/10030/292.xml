title = {An Analysis of Cohesion and Coherence in a Ghazal by Hafez from a Systemic Functional Linguistics Viewpoint}, 
abstract ={Some literary critics have often engaged in debates on the degree of overall cohesion and coherence across the couplets of the Hafez ghazals: some maintain that the Hafez&#8217;s ghazals lack coherence; some others believe that there is cohesion and coherence in the nature of the couplets. This paper presents an analysis of the overall coherence in a ghazal of Hafez- that has a weak cohesion apparently- by using a linguistics framework laid out by Halliday and Hasan (1976 &#38; 1984). Based on this theory, although cohesion is an important property of a text, just finding the cohesive elements does not show that the text is coherent. Rather, after finding these elements, it is necessary to show coherence in a text based on Cohesive Harmony. After doing this analysis, we have found that this ghazal has a very high cohesion and coherence. So, by utilizing this theory - that is a scientific method-&#160; we can probe the degree of &#160;cohesion and coherence in any ghazal of Hafez or other literary texts quantitatively.&#160;},

abstract ={The presence of Arabs in Iran and continuation of this presence for almost 3 centuries in this country has had fundamental effects on Iranian language and literature. Most of researchers have analyzed this fact form the negative view point. In this study we try, by making use of sufficient reasons and from a positive point of view, to show that despite lack of Iranian literature in this era (early Hijri centuries), it can't be construed that we had absolute silence of Iranian literature, yet Iranian language and literature in a dynamic and complex way passed a progressive period in a way that it paved the way for growth of Iranian poetry and literature in the following centuries. Although Iran lost its Pahlavi writing system in this era but with passing of time and along with capabilities of Iranians, Farsi language was born and with widespread use of&#160; Arabic writing system&#160; as an effective and simple&#160; instrument (in comparison with other writing systems)&#160; which thanks to&#160; acceptance of Islam&#160; and wide spread use nationwide , Farsi language&#160; became Iranian national language with the support of independent&#160; rulers. In fact in this era the relation of Iran and Arabs by passing many ups and downs in a bilateral benefit, in one hand caused the unity of language among Iranians and their use of a modern language and its spread and in the other hand, with presence of Iranian elites in expansion of Arabian poetry, valuable services has been paid to Arabic language and Arabic language has passed a progressive era.},

The author has been an arif (mystic) and muhaddith (erudite in Prophet&#8217;s traditions) who has lived in X-XI century from Hijra. His purpose for writing this tractate has been to clarify some aspects of monotheism, faith, irfan and the principles of the mystical Way. The article is an effort to give an answer to the following questions: first, how the author as a&#160; sufi, in the perspective of Oneness of Existence, and a Shia&#8217;s muhaddith can explore the topics of Twelve Shia&#8217;s theology within the paradigm of irfan and deepen in this domain; second, is it convenient and acceptable to the mystical wisdom or not, as a principle, that a sufi can use kalam&#8217;s proofs and demonstrations, knowing the negative mystical attitude toward rational discussions and issues of kalam. After considering the most important features of Shia&#8217;s kalam in the book Rawzat al-arifin and comparing them with the kalam&#8217;s themes, examined by the greatest Shia&#8217;s mutakallimun before the time of our author, we could make the conclusion that he has been Shia&#8217;s mutakallim and arif in the same time, dwelling on irfan to make an explanation of kalam&#8217; s subtleties. And it could be said also that as his irfan is demonstrative (kalami), his kalam is mystical (irfani).},

abstract ={In some instances of comparative literature research, it is not precisely possible to accredit a literary work to a specific nation or ethnic group. The reason, it seems, lies in the lack of a precise definitions of national literature which in turn is due to the imprecision of the standards set for national literature. Whereas one camp, mainly the disciples of the French school of comparative literature, view language the sole, or at least the strongest criterion for setting the domain of international and national literature, the other camp, mainly the proponents of the American school of comparative literature, casting doubts upon the validity and the efficacy of the linguistic criterion, go for a political identity criterion. Of course, along these two criteria, sometimes other criteria such as historical continuity, shared cultural identity, religious and theological borders, political ideologies and even geographical (co-territorial) borders are also posed.&#160;&#160;&#160; To investigate this problem more profoundly, the present authors, criticizing the above-mentioned standards and criteria and displaying their inadequacy and imprecision, have made an attempt to propose cultural components and the cultural discourse dominating the work as a promising standard.&#160;},

abstract ={According to Ferdinand de Sossur- the well-known linguist- the philosophical-intelectual tradition of the west from Plato and Aristotle&#8217;s age, and even before them, up to the 20th century has been influenced by a polarity approach that preferred speech to writing. Accordingly, the complete transfer of meaning was considered to be possible through speech, Meanwhile, writing was considered as a branch and a substitute for speech. A brief look at Islamic Iranian history and culture may indicate that despite the differences in the basics and methods, we find a clear preference for speech in the discourse of thoughts of the classcal languge and literature. More specifically, Nasser khosroo established and organized the important theoreical principles so that the dominant mechanism of speech prevailed in the fields of Islamic rhetorics in&#160; general and Persian rhetorics in particular for many centuries.

Brooks in his book entitled modern and classical poetry maintains that the formalistic nature of poem stems from an array of intricacies of the corresponding society. Further, he adds that critics should delve into literary works in order to capture the details. Brooks in juxtaposition with narrative system of classical poem tries to establish four categories of formalistic system including categorical, rhetorical, abstract, and associational in the modern poetry. Brooks assumes that non- narrative systems are more complex than narrative ones and sometimes they can be integrated. This results in more density and difficulty in poems.

title = {The effect of Persian text translations on appreciation of Iranian history and culture in France}, 
abstract ={The French speakers&#8217; acquaintance with Iranian culture and literature took place later than that of speakers of Latin and Greek. The history of French language should be distinguished from the history of French literature. The French language developed gradually from the 5th century and after the independence from the Roman Empire. That is why the history of French literature was first realized as epic literature in the 12th century corresponding with Crusades. French Christian priests who had an essential role in creating the French language and literature were familiar with Zoroaster via translated Greek or Latin history books. However, more generally, via Bible and Torah, they regarded ancient Iran as the savior of Jews and Jesus Christ. During the Crusades, Iran was constantly regarded as an Arab country. Parallel with movement of Christian priests in the Mongolian period and the Christians&#8217; influence in the royal palace, Iran&#8217;s name became well-known. However, we should regard the influential translations as a production of Christians&#8217; long residence and learning of Persian language during and after the Safavieh period. One may consider two significant periods in the reputation of the name of Iran: The18th Century whose literary works embrace a collection of manuscripts influenced by translations, interpretations, and reproductions. These works were criticized from Renaissance to the end of the 17th century, mostly by monarch messengers, especially Christian missioners, in the form of analytical dictionaries, oriental novels, dramatic subjects, fables and myths. These sources dramatically influenced the woks of such elites as Montesquieu, Voltaire, and the authors of the Diderot encyclopedia who marked the thought crisis period of the Great French Revolution. Although the translations were considered as Platonic, paratextual, and racial due to lack of Persian literacy, they had a drastic effect on the intellectuality of the French society and resulted in the foundation of a significant field named Orientalism in the 19th century. In this era, translation of Persian works was done by trained diplomatic agents in a more organized way. Its influence was realized not only in politics but also in the Romanticism school; specifically, in the works of Victor Hugo and other literary schools such as Symbolism and Surrealism. In ideology and anthropology, Gobineau, who was under the influence of Aryan race, provoked a number of argumentations which, in turn, led to racism in the 20th century.&#160;},

Some mystics believe that after joining and at the presence of the beloved, longing increases and converts to a state of desire. The continuity of longing or converting caused by the presence of the beloved, in turn, lead to an unending journey to God.

Furthermore, a change in the tone of reading or the stress in pronunciation determines the adjective and noun or the noun and adjective. In order to clarify exclusivity of &#8216;singularity, metamorphosis and identification&#8217;, accurate identification of the addressee is highly necessary. Finally, the position of exclusive sentences and implications is not clarified.

Golshiri in Shazdeh Ihtejab has benefitted from various narrative elements; however, it can be argued that the complexity of the narrative techniques of the work is to a great extent due to his use of two elements of &#8220;the voice of narrator&#8221; and &#8220;focalization.&#8221; Selecting the limited third person narrator which is restricted to the minds of two main characters of the work (Shazdeh Ihtejab and Fakhri) and offering the thoughts and sayings of these two characters in direct and indirect discourse has caused the voice of the narrator or narrators to be mixed with the perspective of the focalizer or focalizers and has rendered understanding the relation between narrator and focalizer and the difference between the two difficult. Based on this, in the present article, the two elements of &#8220;voice of the narrator&#8221; and &#8220;focalization&#8221; in the narrative text of Shazdeh Ihtejab are discussed in order to present the artistic use of the two elements in the narrative text of Shazdeh Ihtejab.},

title = {Analyzing the Nonverbal Communication in Beyhaqi’s Narration of Hanging of the Hasanak Minister}, 
abstract ={Communication is one of the main functions of language. Linguistic communication usually combines with other modes of interaction such as nonverbal communication. People&#8217;s nonverbal behaviors display their styles and personality characteristics. Therefore, the fictionists and historians tend to reflect the quality and quantity of the character&#8217;s nonverbal relationship in their narration. The present study examines the adventure of Hanging of the Hasanak Minister in Tarikh-e Beyhaqi in order to show how Beyhaqi succeeds to imagine, objectify and portray the events of Qaznavi's periods and how it could improve the dramatic capacity of historical text with accuracy in nonverbal communication using a descriptive-analytical method and an interdisciplinary approach. This study displays that Beyhaqi often uses nonverbal communication in order to complete the verbal communication; but in many cases, they are replaced by verbal behavior or control the verbal behaviors.},

title = {Functions of mubads in Shahnameh}, 
abstract ={In ancient Iran, mubeds were always among the most prominent authorities of the country and were highly influential in kings&#8217; courts. This role is well depicted in Iran&#8217;s most famous national epic, and it is of such an importance that by examining their roles and positions in Shahnameh, one can find how religion and government were closely related in ancient Iran. In Shahnameh, the mubads&#8217; responsibilities were not just limited to conducting religious ceremonies and rites. They enjoyed power and authority in country&#8217;s administration and were the most educated people of their age. They were responsible for the education and also narrated ancient stories. Observing the economic affairs and bearing the flag in battles were other responsibilities of the mubeds which are also well depicted in Shahnameh. It should be noted that &#8220;mubed&#8221; in Shahnameh is used as a generic term and it is not always used to mean a &#8220;clergy&#8221;. Rather, its meanings had expanded and the term was attributed to wise and erudite people. In this paper, the authors attempt to explain the functions and hierarchies of mubeds according to Ferdowsi&#8217;s Shahnameh.},

title = {Rhythmic Defamiliarization in Naser Khosrow\'s  Poetry}, 
abstract ={This article, first takes a formalist approach and attempts to achieve two goals: defining the term defamiliarization, its essence and function. Then, it illustrates one of the prosodic features of Naser khosrow&#8217;s poetry which could be considered as an appropriate example of rhythmic defamiliarization. For this purpose, seven meters from his Divān, of which rare meters are usually called unpleasant/ unfamiliar, will be discussed; and, according to their different structures, they will be categorized into&#160; two groups: one incorporating six meters, and the other containing only one. The meters of the first group which are mainly analyzed in this study have different length from their current forms. When a poet such as Naser Khosrow employs these infrequent meters in his poetry, it sounds odd to most of Persian readers who are accustomed to the ordinary rhythms. This can be called rhythmic/ prosodic defamiliarization.},

title = {The Reflection of the Events of the Time on Dehkhoda’s Versifications}, 
abstract ={The great scholar Dehkhoda is one of the most outstanding characters of culture and literature of Iran who besides his contributions to political fields played an important role in journalism, research, editing, writing, and versification. He belongs to the time of abundant ups and downs in which Iranian society had passed important events such as Constitutionalism movement, the first and second world wars, Rezakhan&#8217;s despotism and nationalization of oil industry. He is indeed a knowledgeable researcher on political issues and a writer whose political talent had influenced the events of his age or was influenced by them. Some of these events left hesitating reflections on his versifications and a closer investigation of them&#160; may explain the importance of the events and Dehkhoda's ideas. In this article, beside brief explanation on Dehkhoda&#8217;s life, works, cultural services and poetical power, attempts were made to illustrate the reflection of these events on his versification using a descriptive&#8211;analytic method. Obviously, the criticism of functional evaluation of those people named for different excuses is not the aim of this article and claims its own proper opportunity. Result of this research offer a&#160; new understanding about Dehkhoda in the politics field and give clues to the significant events that engaged his mind, as confirmed through the forthcoming events.},

abstract ={Islamic mysticism and Sufism are among important mental and cultural issues which have influenced Islamic &#8211; Iranian culture and Persian language and literature profusely. So the various dimensions of this mental and practical school must be revisited. One way to approach the subject and the end of this school as well as the history and content and changes is to examine the definitions which the pioneers and leading Sufis have provided. In this article, we have a critical look at these definitions in order to know this mental- practical school better and to clarify its hidden dimensions of that. To this end, in addition to referring to the leaders and followers of Sufism, their mental and practical framework will be illustrated.},

title = {Psychological analysis of Hermann Hesse\'s&#34;Siddhartha&#34;story}, 
abstract ={One of the dynamic branches of contemporary literary criticism is psychological&#160;criticism which, in turn, has several subdivisions. One such subdivision is based on Carl Gustav Jung's viewpoint. Hermann Hesse's works can be well criticized and analyzed&#160;through Jung's psychological point of view because his ideas and thoughts are in many ways similar&#160;to those of Jung. They were in close contact and communicated with each other. Both of them were interested in symbols and icons, as well as commenting and analyzing them. Hesse was as introvert as Jung was; he paid&#160;attention to psychological facts and social aspects are meager&#160;in his works. Hesse and Jung liked East mysticism including Indian Gnosticism. India was a link which joined Jung and Hesse. Indians live in the world of symbols; influencing on symbols, being influenced by them, although they didn't like to comment on them. Symbols are&#160;favorite subjects for Jung and Hesse and their dominance in Hesse's works provide an appropriate field for a critical analysis from Jung's point of view. An investigation of symbols and archetypical&#160;criticism of literary works, especially&#160;those works&#160;arising from the soul, is a suitable method for&#160;exploring the hidden meaning&#160;in exterior and surface-structural layers. These analyses may reveal common facts in human soul as well. In this article, the researchers attempt to criticize the Hermann Hesse's &#34;Siddhartha&#34;story based on archetypical approach.Archetypes such as&#160;dream, journey, hero, water, river and passing it ,anima, tree and old wiseman are within important symbols which are assembled harmoniously in&#160; this&#160; story. They represent human effort in his individual and self-realization process. These symbols will be examined in details here in this article.},
