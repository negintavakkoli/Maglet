The high amount of unsustainable revenue resources, mostly building-related ones, has resulted in the municipalities’ uncertainty about their revenue amount due to the very fluctuations. Such an uncertainty has made the municipalities of metropolises and the central governments to guard against it. From among the methods to deal with such uncertain resources are governmental aids and legal permits. In this article, besides investigating into such methods, the legal permit for paying tax on installment plan has been analyzed which is one of the methods for avoiding unsustainable revenue for municipalities.
