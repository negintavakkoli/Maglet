Currently, only a small share of car prices is received as the annual tax of car ownership by the municipality, therefore it is necessary to review the process and the external car costs generated by vehicles, has been internalized. In this research, after the study of determining trends of the tax in other countries, and identification the affecting factors in determination the car use tax using factor analysis, we tried to provide a model to i&lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;nternalize the external costs, in order to increase sustainable revenues for urban management&lt;/span&gt; and optimize urban economy trends. Finally we tried to use know factors in a mathematical functions to calculate a proportional amount to the external costs generated by vehicles in a way that this proposed amount could be able to increase sustainable revenues for urban management and persuade citizens to use low-pollutant vehicles. The main suggestion of this research is to begin the process of increasing the dependence of urban economy and management of metropolitans Municipalities to unsustainable income resources such as building density and replacing them with scientific and sustainable incomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt line-height: 115% font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif&quot;&gt;&lt;!--stripped--&gt;&lt;!--stripped--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the steps taken in the area of bus services in Tehran in recent years, is the transference many services of lines to the private sector. This study seek to determine the effects of privatization on providing bus services in Tehran metropolitan. The importance of Extremist bus lines in mobility and better access to information systems, led this experimental study to carry out within these lines. To a experimental study, we compared the performance of lines 1 and 2 (state lines) and line 7 (private line), during the years 1389 to 1391 using the quarterly data. The most widely used method in this type of study, is data envelopment analysis. The results showed that the relative deficiency of line 7 in comparison to the state lines that from the point of kind of managerial deficiency and scale deficiency which scale deficiency was more intensive. Also the deficiency of private line in the output of passengers' transportation was further than output of travelled kilometres. Therefore, based on the research findings, it seems to entrance the private motivations into bus transit services in ways followed, have negative results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The results showed that the household economic factors included income, price, Rent housing units, household, being House or apartment, access to recreational and educational centers, time and costs of transportation are the main determining factors. The results of this study proved that. the behavior and preferences of families in different neighborhoods is not the same. for example, the increase in prices and rents in neighborhoods with low trading value, have a negative effect on the selections, but in neighborhoods with higher trading value, it means the improvement of the quality of housing, and increased the probability if choices. Also The tendency to apartment units in neighborhoods with high trading value, is higher than low-cost areas.
