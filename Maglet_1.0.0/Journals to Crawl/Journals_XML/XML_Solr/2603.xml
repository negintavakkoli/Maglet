For this purpose, intelligent algorithms based on neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm have been used in this research to predict the tendency to leave an organization. In this regard, a standard dataset was created based on a questionnaire of employees satisfaction and the desire to leave the job in the Karoon Oil and Gas Production Company. Then, using an artificial neural network as a classifier and a multi-objective genetic algorithm, the important factors or features were selected. In the next step, an expert system was proposed to select effective features. In order to test and evaluate the neural network algorithm developed with the standard data set, the necessary training was provided. The results showed that by using the proposed model, not only the willingness of employees to leave the organization can be predicted with more than 88% accuracy, but also, the key factors of leaving the organization can be determined.</field></doc></add>
