Thus, the current study, taking a descriptive-analytical approach, investigates the status quo of electronic municipality in the metropolis of Qom. The results indicate that despite some positive measures taken for the actualization of electronic municipality in the city, there are still some problems such as lack of enjoying updated experts in IT issues, deficiency in educating staff to make them familiar with updated electronic systems, and in some cases, lack of attention to CRM. All in all, with regard to the suggestions, observations, pieces of research, and the documents obtained from the very municipality, odds are great that the metropolis of Qom change into a pioneer in electronic municipality in the nation.&#160;},
