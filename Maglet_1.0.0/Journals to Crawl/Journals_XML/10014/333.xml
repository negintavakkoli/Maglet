However, HR performance Improvement has had less important compared to other resources of organizations. There is no doubt that effective training is the best way to improve and boost human resource performance in workplaces. A manager is competent if he /she demonstrates required competency of his/her job. But, the most important point is that whether having competent project managers can result in desirable performance of their projects or not. The authors in the first step have defined competency, project manager competency, and project performance and maturity. Then, they have evaluated maturity of projects as well as competency of project managers of a state company as a case study (subsidiary of Iran Oil Ministry).

First, the qualitative research interviews were conducted to collect the experts' opinions in order to identify and classify the related criteria. Second, a quantitative methodology was used in order to rank the identified criteria using &amp;quot;Grey Multi Attribute Decision Making&amp;quot; approach.</description>
