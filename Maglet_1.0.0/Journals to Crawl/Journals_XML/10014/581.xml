(Case Study: Isfahan Gas Company)}, 
abstract ={The purpose of this research was to preparation the theory of managerial competency using grounded theory. The 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 managers selected purposefully (maximum variation sampling) from among the different levels of management in Isfahan Gas Company. Also, Gas monthly magazine, web sites of&#160; National Iranian Gas Company and&#160; thirty province and&#160; job description of managers selected purposefully (theoretical sampling) and studied. Then based on grounded theory, in the open coding phase, concepts were collected and categorized into 8 main categories and 78 sub categories. In the phase of axial coding, the link between these categories were determined in the form of coding paradigm under titles of causal conditions, core phenomenon, mutual action/reaction strategies, context, intervening conditions, obstacles, and the consequences of managerial competencies. In the selective coding phase, the story line was sketched out and the propositions were generated. Finally، theory fitting accepted.},

abstract ={This article, explains a model for evaluating productivity of human resource management. The research used a filed survey method. The research design is developing &#8211;practical by using mixed method in data gathering and its analysis. The statistical population of study is Iranian Oil and Gas Industry. For data analysis, structural equation model is used. On the base of results, there is a linear relation between forth dimensions of research model. Effectiveness in strategic level (with performing strategic partner role) is independent variable, Efficiency dimensions in Strategic and operational Level (with performing HR developer and Management of Firm Infrastructure roles) are intermediate variable and effectiveness dimension in operational level (with performing servicing stakeholders) is dependent variable. The developed model can apply for evaluating, diagnosis and analyzing the productivity of HRM system in Iranian oil and Gas Industry},
