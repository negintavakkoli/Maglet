Systems Architecture is a generic discipline to handle objects (existing or to be created) called systems, in a way that supports reasoning about the structural properties of these objects. Systems Architecture is a response to the conceptual and practical difficulties of the description and the design of complex systems. Systems Architecture is a generic discipline to handle objects (existing or to be created) called systems, in a way that supports reasoning about the structural properties of these objects. System architecting has been around since the Egyptians built the pyramids.  The pyramids presented an enormous number of problems for its designers due to the size of the structure, the lack of proper tools, and the need to make it a tomb fit for a god-king.  Now we are faced with similar problems of system complexity that has outstripped our system building techniques in the area of embedded computer systems.   Heuristics, models, and metaphors help architects abstract away complexity, but much of the difficulty in architecting lies in maintaining a unified vision of the system.  Having a unified vision makes it much easier to create safe, dependable, or fast systems.  Unfortunately, not everyone is a great system architect, and it may never be possible to teach someone all of the necessary skills.  This poses some fundamental limitations on the systems we can create.
