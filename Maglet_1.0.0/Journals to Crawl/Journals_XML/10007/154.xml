Islamic Sufism is one major issue in Gnosticism which lasts for twelve centuries since its foundation. This subject has been paid essential attention regarding that an important part of social and religious culture of Muslims is founded on Gnosticism issues. Regard that complete understanding of Islamic culture may not be achieved without recognition of Gnosticism and Sufism and no one can ignore this important phenomena. On the other hand, Sufism is an extended school in Iranian Islamic society and it is an integrated part of religious, literary, and national history of Iran subject to issues of Gnosticism.This paper tends to investigate monastery of Sheikh Safi-AldinArdebili and ChalapiOghlu in Zanjan and monastery of Molana in Qunieh. We tend to compare and contrast similarities and differences of the studied monasteries regarding to Sufism religious ways and spatial hierarchy and form variation in designing monastery spaces. This paper used descriptive-analytical-comparative and contrast method and collected information based on library based studies. Evidences show that monastery of Sheikh Safi-AldinArdebili was founder of Sufism and it includes seven stages of spiritual evolution. Sheikh Safi-AldinArdebili affected on Anatoly and Syria and etc.Monastery of ChalapiOghlu in comparison with Sheikh Safi-AldinArdebili monastery has unique integration in elements and plans and its linear analysis of its plan show an imitation from central idea of Sheikh Safi-AldinArdebili monastery.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
