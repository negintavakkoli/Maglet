						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=459&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;During last three decades, because of rapid influx of population into the cities, many problems have been emerged for cities. Thus, it is necessary to plan and present models in order to regulate urban network to reduce and organize emerging problems. Finding factors resulting from these events, presenting solution in order to reduce unfavorably existing situation, and move toward balance in population and activity distribution are some of the most concerns of planners and city managers. In this research, the relationship between urban facilities and population distribution in urban network was studied by evaluating level of enjoying municipal facilities in urban areas of Yazd Province. In terms of research type, it is developmental-applied and in terms of method, it is descriptive-analytical. Data were collected by library studies, documents of Iran&amp;rsquo;s Statistical Center, statistical yearbook, and relevant documents. To analyze data and reach to practical results, numerical Taxonomy model and numerical analysis process were used. The results indicate that presented facilities and services in urban areas have fairly big influence on balanced distribution of population; therefore, deductive rank of Taxonomy analysis that indicates level of enjoying facilities in the areas is in line with the rank of population distribution. In this regard, indexes relevant with municipal facilities and services can considerably play effective role on absorbing population, avoiding immigration, and decentralization in different areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>Ranking Components of Householdâ€™s Residential Movement Model Emphasizing on Economic View of Housing  (Case Study: Seyyed Khandan Neighborhood-Tehran District 3)</title>
						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=461&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;One of the aspects of city dynamism is households&amp;rsquo; movement from one residential neighborhood to other ones inside the city. These movements that affect city structure have various reasons. Assessing the reasons of household&amp;rsquo;s residential movement is very complex task since it is due to the concept of residential satisfaction or dissatisfaction. However, this movement, depending on the type of ownership, can be done based on people&amp;rsquo;s indexes and factors. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze and prioritize importance of residential movement indexes emphasizing on the type of people and households&amp;rsquo; ownership in Seyyed Khandan neighborhood of Tehran. To determine sample size of the case study, Cochran formula was used and 175 questionnaires were distributed in the neighborhood. However, in order to prioritize residential indexes in two aspects of (owner/tenant), Entropy and qualitative method of SAW were used. This paper indicates that educated landowners have high tendency and jobless landowners have low tendency to move. This may be due to their fear of losing the ownership of their residential units because of fluctuations in the housing market. However, tenants who earn high income tend to have successive movements greatly and those who are unemployed or earn low revenue prefer to stay in their residential environment. Therefore, it is recommended that banking facilities and urban projects to be increased in line with providing houses for households in order to reduce their repetitive movements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=465&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;Urban green space is one of the most important components in city management and cities&amp;rsquo; development given its social and environmental functions and financial and economic aspects. Different species of plants including trees, shrubs, cover crops and flowers or seasonal plants have specific features in terms of climate-compatible of Tehran and water demand. They also have different roles in meeting expected functions of urban green space, particularly prettification and reducing air pollution by producing oxygen. Thus, this paper tries to study selection criteria, assess plant species, and determine appropriate criterion for Tehran green space. Then, it determines relative weight of each one by surveying 35 experts&amp;rsquo; view in the form of group analytical hierarchy process (GAHP) method. The obtained weights are instruments for valuation of 60 Tehran&amp;rsquo;s main plant species done by simple valuation (linear) and TOPSIS methods.&amp;nbsp; The results indicated that evergreen oak, elm, and silver cypress are the most valuable species. Ranking of plant species were obtained by two mentioned methods in each of four groups that they were almost matched with each other. Using these ranks has increased at least 33 percent of productivity cost of urban green space in replanting project of municipality districts as well as increasing citizens&amp;rsquo; satisfaction and life of plant species that is in line with resistance economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
