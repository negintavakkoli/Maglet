The importance of this issue is to the extent that many other urban issues such as the urban hierarchy of access, utilities distribution and etc. are influenced by this issue and so, defining the optimal size of the city, is very important. Till now, some research have been done in this regard but innovation of this research is that has responded to the problem of &amp;quot;the optimal size of the city&amp;quot; based on Islamic view and in particular juridical view. In this way, by citing the juridical teachings of Shiite, First, the favorable geometric system for the Islamic city and the center of this system, is inferred and then, by citing the juridical rulings of the jameh mosque (as the geometric center of the city), minimum and maximum acceptable size for the city is concluded.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-font-family: Garamond; mso-hansi-font-family: Garamond;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Garamond&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;So, the main axis in the process of &lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;data analysis in this article is the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; juridical&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; rules and laws of &lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;prayer on the day of the congregation (Friday) and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;consequently, the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; juridical&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; rules and laws of &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;jameh mosque. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;The most important&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;religious&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;document in this regard is the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;chapter Jumue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; in the holy Quran &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;in particular,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;its final&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;verses which&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;are cited&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;as follow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; Believers, when you are called to prayer on the day of the congregation (Friday), hasten to the remembrance of Allah and put your trading to one side.

						<title>Analysis of the Concept of Utopia in Political Thought of Imam Ali </title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=965&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p&gt;Utopia can be considered as one of the oldest human aspirations; where man had only one wish and that was the realization of happiness and prosperity along with justice and equality. Many thinkers and philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Farabi, and Mulla Sadra had always sought to explain the idea of a utopia throughout history. Imagination of an ideal society for mankind covers a major part of the discussions on the history of human philosophy and this human aspiration has always been exposed to discuss and challenge. This challenge is towards a real approach to the city in which large and small social groups benefit from a prosperous life, full of grace and equality at all levels. We know that many great men throughout history have always sought to establish a utopian and social justice-oriented government. Although their efforts and suffering should not be ignored, they ultimately may have reached their utopia only to some extent. In this study, after referring to the concepts and theories of utopia, part of the political history of the life of Ali (AS) is described and, among the historical social interactions in the era of Ali (AS), an unequivocal response will be given for proving the existence of the idea of a utopia during the caliphate of Imam Ali (AS).&lt;/p&gt;

						<description>&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: -2.3pt;&quot;&gt;Rules and regulations governing the urban systems are considered as a common point of Legal Studies and Planning. On the other hand, urban system as one of key elements of the relationship between the state and the nation regulates the proportionality between people and public based on private low and public low. To recognize the structure of public and private law in the urban system of the country it is necessary to answer the question &amp;ldquo;what is the entity of the urban rules and regulations of country in the light of Islamic laws and regulations?&amp;rdquo; the methodology of research based on the system interpretation of the urbanization of the country is in order of governing on the legal sources. This analysis is qualitative and determined using Logical reasoning technique and documentary studies method. Analysis of the actors of the private and public spaces of cities on the one hand and the redefinition of the public and private rights in the legal order of country on the other hand, guides us to the new pattern and approach regarding the rights of urban studies. This approach, by providing multiple needs and Compatibility varied interests between the private and public spheres, leads to the manifestation of civil rights ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of these behaviors are tied with the housing and dependent on an appropriate structure and also designing a house is directly affected by some Islamic rules. However, Muslims modern housing has been affected by western housing patterns and lacks required proportionate for Islamic life style and does not represent Islamic identity. This research was conducted in order to studying the management of human and social issues in the ideal and optimal housing social characteristics for Muslims by investigating in Islamic authentic texts including Quran and narratives of the holy prophet (peace be upon him) and Imams for using in Muslims contemporary architecture. For doing so, while proposing a theoretical framework including definitions and viewpoints on the topic, the Islamic contents and concepts on housing and residency were extracted from the main texts including Quran and its different commentaries and narratives, explanations and jurisprudents and Islam history. Buy investigating in the main Islamic texts it is seen that house is one of the main centers of management the social relations and religious texts have proposed definitions of neighborhood rights and confinement by stating the importance of neighborhood and its consequences and ordered on the meeting relatives and acceptance of gests and holding religious meetings by the aim of surviving the guardianship issue and familiarity with region. Familiarity with these characteristics and reflection in the housing architecture can provide the context for reaching optimal Islamic housing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The first step in this direction through this subject, principles and definitions are relevant to the topic. In the next step, given the lack of similar experiences in studies and research within the country using comparative research, all with a focus on existing experience and global reach thermal compatibility issues Psychology collected and categorized. And It then outlines a number of best practices have been investigated and Finally, sum up experiences, psychological factors affecting adjustment to achieve thermal comfort is provided. In the end, after analyzing the experiences investigated, vacuum collection on the matter, scheduled for completion in the form of future research and proposed the hypothesis that there is a connection between the &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;psychological adjustment to achieve thermal comfort&amp;rdquo; spaces public suggested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<title>The Study and Analysis of Changes in Sultanates Architectural Forms and Elements in Beylik’s Era and Their Role in the Rise of Ottomans Architecture</title>

As if between the fall of Sultanate of Rum and the establishment of Ottoman in 1299 A.D. there was not any artistic or architectural work in Anatoly. Such idea is no longer accepted today, as after the Sultanate of Rum fall, the autonomous Turkmen Emirates were present in the diverse areas of Anatoly, and some of them challenged the increasing spread of Ottoman until the 14th century and in some cases even until the 15th century. Needless to say, in the era of Beyliks, the residents in such Emirates especially artists and architects worked somehow and through their work they designed and constructed religious or general buildings. The conducted studies show that the design and construction of buildings in that period of time was actually a kind of linking element between Seljuqs architecture and Ottoman architecture. In sum, although the forms and styles presented in the magnificent works of the Ottoman era have roots in Seljuq architecture, they have actually developed in the period of Anatoly autonomous Emirates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						<description>&lt;p&gt;Urbanization of the world and globalization of cities are most important aspect of social life in the third millennium A.D. Regardless of negative consequences of globalization all cities seek to join the global cities network in order to enjoy the advantages of globalization. Iran&amp;rsquo;s cities, because of delay in joining the global economic, foreign politics and consequently the problems resulting from absence of foreign investment in country, come across with many barriers in the process of globalization. At border cities of Iran the above mentioned circumstances in addition to peculiar geopolitical conditions of the border cities make the process more difficult. The present study aims to measure the status of Chabahar in the process of globalization and to evaluate its improvement. In order to achieve the study objectives, by using the questionnaires and interviews with 365 citizens of Chabahar, the appropriate perspective of local abilities and potentials about the function of various factors was gained after that, by using the correlation test the relation of those factors to the globalization process was analysed. The results of the study revealed that the correlation of the globalization process to communications is more than average and to housing is average and to development of financial affairs, transportation as well as job and revenue is very high. The correlation of these factors indicates that if we can coordinate the facilities, courses and limitations of regional improvement in different fields with forces and globalization courses, the improvement of items mentioned as well as solutions to its problems will be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
