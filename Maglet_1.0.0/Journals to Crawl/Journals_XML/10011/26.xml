		<Abstract>Enterprise resource planning system is a software package with extensive application which integrates all organizational functions in a single system. To implement an ERP project in an organization successfully, selecting an appropriate system considering effective factors is necessary. The purpose of this study is to identify effective factors in selecting ERP. This study has used expert choice to investigate content validity and Cronbach Alpha (0.79) to consider reliability of the research questionnaire. Seven factors are identified by exploratory factor analysis including general specifications, implementation costs, price, vendor, functional capabilities, project management and software quality capabilities. Finally, some suggestions to choose an appropriate ERP system are presented.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The achievement of eLearning goals is one of the challenges which many universities, including the University of Tehran, are faced with. Since the teacher in electronic and virtual space facilitates and manages learning activities by presenting creative methods, reinforcing these methods is one of the ways to achieve eLearning goals. However, one of the factors which influences on choosing these methods is the perceptions of teachers in this field about their roles. Thus, the goal of the current study is to research different methods of e-Teachers in order to manage teaching-learning process in virtual space. The researcher presumes the effect of teachers&#039; &quot;perception and attitude&quot; about their roles on &quot;teaching and managing method&quot;. Therefore, the background related to the research has been studied alongside studying the forum available in this field, and then, a representative sample of these discussions, which indicates teaching methods in the University of Tehran, is selected, and finally, they have been analyzed using Q methodology, and four patterns of attitude were emerged. The researcher names the obtained patterns of attitude: knowledge transmitter, participator, intermediary, and e-Content designer. Among the emerged roles, knowledge transmitter&#039;s role is the dominant compared to the other three roles.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Recent growth and developments in internet and electronic services play a significant role in banking industry all over the world especially in Iran. It caused an intensive competition between governmental and non- governmental banks in the field of using e-banking services in a way that each bank attempts to attract more customers using high-quality e-services. Ways of delivering services, quality of services and specifications of e-banking services have direct relationship with tendencies and orientations of customers in using e-banking services. This fact also affects satisfaction and loyalty of customers. In this situation, customers will be more high-expected for receiving e-services in higher quality. By investigating e-banking literature; authors discovered lack of a comprehensive model for evaluating different aspects of e-banking services. As a result, the purpose of this research is to deeply explore the broad literature and to identify the most significant factors and indicators in evaluating the quality of e-banking services. Then by defining fuzzy set of factors affecting the selection of e-banking services which includes quality of service and trust, ease of use, responsiveness, information quality and also defining fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy rules, a comprehensive fuzzy inference system is provided so as to evaluate the tendency to use of e-banking services for Iranian banks. Finally satisfaction of e-banking services in Sepah bank as the first Iranian bank is evaluated through the model developed in this research.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Beside developing strategies, success of organizations depends on alignment of strategies. One of the important functional areas in which companies develop strategies is operation. Alignment of operation strategies is called horizontal alignment. The aim of this article is to present a model for alignment of operation strategies. To this end, an original algorithm has been presented by which horizontal alignment of operation strategies in food and chemical (detergents) industries have been analyzed. . In order to develop the alignment model, descriptive-survey and correlation methods were used. Data for this research have been studied with regard to alignment by using data mining methods and Clementine software. The results indicated that alignment affects performance. Proper alignments in the aforementioned industries were identified and appropriate guidelines were recommended to companies.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>This research aims at developing original components of Decision Support System (DSS) in order to support the evaluation and selection of suppliers in multi products having limited capacity. To achieve this purpose, researchers have proposed three different models based on which suppliers allow selecting their own desired type of discount. Firstly based on the performed studies, some criteria have been suggested for evaluating the suppliers’ capability. These criteria will be selected by the buyer with respect to the purchase condition and type of the industry, and their importance level will be determined. Then based on multi-criteria decision models, evaluation of all the suppliers will be done. In this study fuzzy numbers are applied so as to translate qualitative criteria into quantitative one. Suppliers have been ranked according to the scores they have gained and the selection share of each from the whole quantity has been determined based on the multi-objective mathematical model. The existing model has exerted practical ways such as taking loans with determined interest as well as certain variables in order to compensate the shortage of budget the buyer encounters with. Outputs, which are, the selective suppliers and orders assigned to each of them are also to be considered by using Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB software for three parts in Emersan Company accordingly.</Abstract>

Methodologies used and aligned technology to business always was considered by firms, large and small companies and organizations. Until now, various models have been introduced for alignment to help organization apply alignment in their business. Each of these models, indicators and measures of self-importance has been reviewed. In this research, in the first step the famous and widely used models have been presented the role of IT in business or an organization, from strategic, alignment, operational, functional direction and other aspects of information technology in business. In the next step, reviewing and comparing adaptive models to extract the parameters will be addressed. After aggregating the indicators, common areas and overlaps will be removed and then the model will be obtained. This model represents the alignment and the more comprehensive indicators of each individual model. In assessing the alignment, structural equation modeling will be used to change indicator’s quality with quantity.</Abstract>
