After that, it is necessary to remove these factors in next trainings to provide the needful knowledge and skills consistent with business condition for managers. Needed data gathered through the content analysis of manager`s ideas about the training programs of national Iranian oil company (NIOC) and then a questionnaire developed based on them. In this research ۳۸۰ managers of NIOC participated. Findings show that the demands of managers depend on their work, education and work experience. However, training programs in the first half of the day, outside of work site, as a workshop or with mixed method have a higher priority from the managers perspective. In this research, also, the needed training subject as well as the solutions for improvement in organizational trainings from the managers point of view were investigated.
