This research is an exploratory kind and in terms of method is a survey kind. The data collection tool is questionnaire. After two Delphi cycles, in final questionnaire the detachment variable was eliminated and for Autogeny variable 10 questions, Heterogeny 11 questions and discretion 17 questions were regulated, therefore it can be said the ostensible and content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed. Also since Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was higher than 0.7, it indicates acceptable reliability of the questionnaire. In order to analyze the data, Friedman test with applying SPSS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;software was used. The results showed, the structural dimension with average grade of 1.83 had higher average than contextual dimension which means in Discretion factor, the structural dimension has more readiness for ideal situation. Also the structural dimension with average grade of 2 had higher average than contextual dimension which means in Heterogeny factor, structural dimension has more readiness for ideal situation. And finally, the contextual tent dimension with average grade of 1.91 had higher average than structural dimension which means in Autogeny factor, the contextual dimension has more readiness for ideal situation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
