		<Abstract>The Chief Privacy Officers (CPO) are faced with many and varied responsibilities and roles. In this paper, a fuzzy expert system is designed, called &quot;Chief Privacy Officer Fuzzy Expert System (CPOFEX)&quot;, to inform the Chief Privacy Officer about &quot;the Status of the Privacy of Government and Businesses (G-B) E-Transactions&quot;. To develop the research model and knowledge base of the mentioned expert system, the concepts of “the Chief Privacy Officers (CPO) Capability“, “Electronic Crimes Intents“, “Type of Government and Business E-Transactions“, “Professional Ethics-Orientation in E-Transactions Parties“, “Privacy Protector Technologies in Enterprise“ were identified, as components of &quot;the Status of the Privacy of Government and Businesses E-Transactions&quot;. To validate the mentioned expert system, the outputs of the system were compared with the experts views. This system can help to analyze &quot;the status of the privacy of government and businesses e-transactions&quot;, and provide more accurate advices.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Mobile banking as a subset of e-banking is one of the newest communication channels between banks and customers. Via m-banking, customers receive services such as checking their bank account balance, transfer of funds, pay bills and etc. However, the rate of m-banking among Iranian users is very low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of user’s self-efficacy on m-banking satisfaction. According to the developed research model, information quality, service quality, system quality, reputation and structural assurance are factors that influencing trust and satisfaction of m-banking and users’ self-efficacy moderates this relationship. This study is a quantitative research and a sample of 230 Iranian m-banking users has been surveyed. Research hypotheses were tested by structural equation modeling. The results showed that effect of service quality on trust, system quality on trust, system quality on satisfaction, reputation on trust, structural assurance on trust and trust on satisfaction were significant. This study also showed the role of self-efficacy as a moderator between the relationship of service quality, system quality and reputation with trust. Finally, recommendations were proposed for customer satisfaction of m-banking.       </Abstract>

		<Abstract>With the development of Internet of things (IOT) technologies in recent years, the development of knowledge management systems based on them, as well as the role of these systems in different organizational areas such as staff performance management should be considered. The objective of this study is to design an application based on the IOT, and analysis of its role in staff performance improvement. The methodology of this study is action research based on the design of information systems with RAD approach and prototyping design method, and focus on one of the performance indicators of the Yazd municipality staff, namely daily working time. The proposed knowledge management based structure to control the entry and exit of staff in the case of study, and implementation of its prototype indicated that IOT can play roles in improving staff performance in six specific areas in two parts of data collection and management of entry and exit. In general, IOT could be used as a reliable basis to generate required data for knowledge management in knowledge based processes, especially knowledge discovery in physical and digital environments.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Maintain and enhance the quality of human resources and achieve maximum value from IT industry employees is the most important concern of managers. Most of researches in this area focus on companies’ endeavour to recruiting qualified experts in the IT industry in the next decade. The selection of qualified personnel for organizations which focus on human resouces as a strength, will be a major issue. Therefore, in this study, companies active in the field of information technology as one of the technology companies, have been examined for optimal absorption of manpower. In the present study, multi-criteria decision-making is used. IT active companies are studied in the current research. In order to design the proper employment model of this companies and due to a variety of quantitative and qualitative parameters, TOPSIS multi attribute decision making (MADM) model is used for prioritization of employment alternatives. Moreover Meta synthesis method is employed to extract the effective indices in the scientific literature. Among authentic researches, finally 7 indices are selected for TOPSIS weighted measure. According to the model, 33 alternatives are investigated at a sample active company. The model is used for three types of professions: IT project manager, information systems analyst and computer programmer. Our model is compared with the traditional methods of personnel selection. The results, shows the consistency between the model and traditional methods. At the end, cause of some contradictions is discussed.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>Corporate governance is the system by which corporations are directed and controlled. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which company objectives are established, the means to achieve these objectives, and how to monitor their performance. ICTs have the potential to make organization and its services more transparent by providing easy access to information. This research aims to evaluate the relationship between information technology governance and corporate governance. The survey sample population consisted of 178 randomly taken managers and employees who work in public organizations. To examine the hypothesis, we use canonical correlation analysis. An important part of results from canonical correlation analysis indicated that there is a proper linear mixture between the variables of canonical effective factors on corporate governance and its components.</Abstract>

		<Abstract>The goal of this article is to proposing a conceptual model explaining the Information Systems Integration. In this paper, passing the concept of Intra-Organizational Information Systems Integration, we emphasis on the concept of Inter-Organizational Integration.The problem is what the Information Systems Integration is, and which problems the organizations face.The method using in this research is a four step method proposed according to the system thinking and related theories in this domain. Due to the fact that, emphasizing on the Inter-Organizational Information Systems, at the first step we draw an expanded conceptual model of the Organizational Informatics Doman between the two organizations. After that, this model expands within the network of organizations. This model has a lot of applications. For example, using this model, we can provide a list of the important and required managerial and technical issues for the successful implementation of integration projects, which these expensive projects and programs will fail without this notification. Moreover, aggregating cognitive propositions extracting from this model, we are able to achieve an initial theory regarding Information Systems Integration.</Abstract>
