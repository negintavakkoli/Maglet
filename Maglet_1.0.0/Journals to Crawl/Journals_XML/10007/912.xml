						<title>Criteria Prioritization for Feasibility Studies of Multilevel Urban Roads Construction by Factor Analysis</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=103&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>It's not too hard to see how urbanization and boost of vehicle production have been increasing the tendency toward using private vehicles in decades. Consequently, demand rate have been increased and, now, traffic jam is an inseparable part of urban road networks. Therefore, beside demand management policies, expanding roads' capacity is also inevitable. Although road capacity could be easily increased by adding new lanes in past, various limitations make building multilevel roads more popular rather than constructing additional lanes in many metropolitans. In this paper, authors try to determine effective factors in urban multilevel road feasibility studies by studying other countries' experiences and designing a questionnaire based on collected data.  Transportation and urban design experts are asked to fill the questionnaires and the factors are classified and prioritized by factor analysis. The results illustrate that &quot;Road level of service in peak hours&quot;, &quot;Historical places' preservation&quot;,&quot; Noise pollution&quot;, &quot;Capital cost&quot;, &quot;protecting urban linear centers&quot;, &quot;Number of bottlenecks&quot;, &quot;safety considerations (number of accidents)&quot;, and &quot;Link's daily volume&quot; are the best 8 chosen factors for further studies. These factors could cover 30 proposed measures without wasting time and money. </description>

						<title> Social sustainability measurement based on the residents views</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=167&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Due to the nature of development which is mainly concentrated on the cities and that more attention paid to physical and geometric aspects than social ones in urban development plans, cities have faced a kind of negative cycle of socio-economic and environmental imbalances. This created many challenges in terms of poverty, crime and delinquency, cultural conflicts, declining quality of life, social disorganization and etc. Sustainable development approach usually considers small unit of urban structure, namely the neighborhood, in planning and urban management of cities and tries to identify existing potentials across the neighborhood regarding its social dimension to restore and improve existing conditions and make it more flexible and resilience to future problems. In this regard, residents' attitudes towards the neighborhood are great important because their views reflect general conditions of the neighborhood and more details of people's living environment. Moreover, people's perception of the neighborhood can clarify the reality of the environment, those aspects which are so important social dimension of planning. The main goal of this research is to examine the level of social sustainability in the neighborhood of Faizabad, Kermanshah based on the residents view of their neighborhood. The results can pave the way for some strategies to restore and refresh social sustainability. The main research strategy is quantitative which utilizes a kind of descriptive – analytical method based on the correlation analysis to identify social sustainability measurements of the neighborhood. Based on the results, all criteria have a direct impact on the neighborhood social sustainability, but the intensity of their impact is different. In this respect, satisfaction, social security and social stability measurements have the highest correlation with the concept of social sustainability in the neighborhood. This means that they were recognized by the residents as the most effective factors affecting the level of social sustainability in Faizabad neighborhood.</description>

						<title>An Investigation of Local Residents’ Attitude to the Policy of Transformation of Villages to Towns According to Settlements (case study: Dailaman District, Siahkal Township)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=227&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>There is a bias for transformation of villages to towns in the developing countries because it is thought that small towns have roles in the national, regional and local development. This research based on studying in Dailaman district is going to assess local residents’ attitude to transformation of villages to towns in achievement of the development. The type of research is applied and its method is descriptive-analytical. Required information was collected through the library and field studies. The main tool for data collection was a researcher-designed questionnaire.  For analyzing the data, descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used. Although both groups of respondents comment on the failure of the policy of transformation of villages to towns, the extent of its effects in the region has been different according to the settlements. It means the extent of its effects in the town, is more than the villages. Thus, there is a meaningful difference between two groups' attitude about the policy of the transformation of villages to towns in the development according to the settlements (villages or towns). The extent of its effects has been varied in different dimensions. The greatest impact has been on the social- cultural dimensions and then physical- environmental dimensions and in the end, economical dimensions. </description>

						<title>An Impact of Growth Control and Containment Policies on The Trend of Peri-urban Settlements Evolutions in Tehran Metropolitan Fringe</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=209&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;The transition process from rural to urban areas in the fringe of Tehran metropolis, or in other words peri-urbanization has had a rapid growth in recent decades. One of the forces contributing to such evolutions is the growth control and containment policies assigned to the city which consist of large scale measures such as green-belt or urban growth boundary (UGB) definitions along with small scale measures such as urban development regulations and land-use zoning in comprehensive plans. Outward spillover from population centers with firm growth control  policies to spaces without such policies has resulted in sporadic peri-urbanization and emergence of mushroom peri-urban settlements in Tehran metropolitan region, specially in its southern areas. This research aims to analyze the transition of development spillover resulted from growth control to peri-urbanization in the metropolitan  fringe of Tehran which takes place in case such political fragmentation through the local governance territories in the region. This analysis is based on the demographic changes in settlements in Tehan’s metropolitan fringe in 1996 to 2006.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
