				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In this study, one basic question will be answered: Why were women officially considered being the subject of policy making decisions in Reza Khan Era? The answer should be found in the particular logic of the discourse of that time which was “Archeological Nationalism”. The discourse is based on racist theory and understands social and cultural issues on the same basis. During the gap emerged between Constitutional Revolution and failure of the regime evolved by that revolution and the time Reza Khan took the throne, the belief based on the strategy of bright autocracy was built up among political elite and nationalist social forces that the strategy of developing and rebuilding the society of Iran is the reform in Iranian people’s corrupt nature. It is clear that in the framework of archeological nationalism changing the nature of Iranians was not possible except through racial purification. Marriage is the core of the strategy and women as one of the parties in marriage, as a person who gives birth to babies and as a mother who brings up the new Iranian generation had a particular place among ancient nationalists.  For this very reason women were the main addressees of social policy making of the government and the elite nationalists with “Hijab Removal” as the most prominent policy.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The increasing trend in women's market employment since 1950s in the world has been documented as the most important indication for 'the revolution in gender roles' (Davis 1984, Cotter et al 2001). Despite the significant capabilities of women and the substantial achievements facilitating female labor force participation in the recent years (such as substantial increase both in women's university education and in their mean age at marriage, a significant fall in fertility rate, and the increasing trend in positive attitude towards women's work outside the home), women in Iran still hold a low level of employment. The low rate of women's employment mainly lies in socio-cultural circumstances that are reproduced by educational systems and school-textbooks.Using the content analysis technique, this article highlights the main patterns and characteristics of women's employment represented in the textbooks of three levels of the Iranian schools: primary, intermediate, and high schools. In general, the results of this study show that the traditional pattern of gender roles inside and outside the home and the male breadwinner model (McDonald 2000) has been evidently represented in the textbooks. According to the results, there are two other key characteristics for women's employment. First, working women are represented in very limited types of work. Second, they often deal with their same-sex clients. Finally, the results show that these patterns vary partly in terms of the title of the textbooks and the three levels of schools.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Spousal homicide is a personal, domestic and social problem which has mortal and morbid effects on public safety. Domestic homicide, especially spousal homicide, is typically unlike stranger murder, not a crime of sudden, unanticipated violence. Rather, these murders hide the tragic story of escalated domestic violence, strain and personal and social harmful consequences in them that require serious study. 
So the aim of this research is to identify social-cultural factors leading to spousal homicide which has been increased considerably in last years and involve many men and women as a "murder" or "victim". By applying qualitative method of research, we try to achieve this aim. For this reason, through random sampling, we select 34 files of spousal homicide incidents that occurred in Tehran between 1380 and 1387. Half of these files belong to spousal homicide of men and the rest half belong to spousal homicide of women. By applying content analysis technique, we have analyzed and examined all of these files. 
The result of this research show that the presence of social-psychological strain on men and women in the family, in the absence of social and personal support system and association with delinquent peers and blockage of legal coping ways, lead couples to commit spousal homicide. Results also show different patterns of killing and factors between men and women.
Moreover demographic variables such as social-economical status of couples and their families, couple's age and age disparity, age and the number of children also affecting spousal homicide.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This research was administered with the purpose of studying the moderating role of female gender schemas in relations between feminine role models, job ladder and networking opportunity with procedural justice in promotion of women teachers in Yazd, Kerman and Esfahan city. On the basis of the research aims, 280 women teachers were selected from above mentioned cities (from Esfahan 100 women teachers and from Yazd and Kerman 180 women teachers). Research questionnaires consisted of: procedural justice in promotion, feminine role models, networking, and formal job ladder (Lemons, 2003), social desirability (Strahan &amp; Gerbasi, 1972) and gender schemas (Spence &amp; Helmreich, 1978). Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and regression analysis. 
Results revealed that, when women teacher believed in the nontraditional roles (on the basis of nontraditional gender schemas), such as extensive affairs for advancement and promotion outside of the home, they interpret the existence of women teachers in managerial position and existence of clear path for women teachers to access managerial positions, as a sign of consideration of justice in decision makings.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Poverty, in general and women’s poverty in particular is among social problems which has been subject to be mitigated through measures. The results of statistics based studies show that poverty and injustice is more prevalent in rural areas than cities and more common among women than men. The research aims to study   the social and cultural causes of women’s poverty through the qualitative approach based on Grounded theory. In this research, sampling has been done purposively. Participants who were interviewed as a group in this research included housewives, women householders and young girls under the aegis of Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. The main questions of this research were: what have been the determinants of poverty from the view of rural girls and women? What have been their individual strategies to tackle the problem of poverty?  What have been the aftermaths? The Findings of this study showed that social ignorance, clan clashes, preference to men in the family, fatalism, intergenerational poverty, highly populated families, educational limitations, unemployment and imposed war and its aftermath have been the reasons of poverty from the view points of participants. The result showed that cultural and social factors are important causes of poverty.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Today consumption has turned to be one of the most important concepts in our modern world. Although it used to be a way to satisfy basic needs of humans in the past, it can be regarded as a social phenomenon in which individuals are trying satisfy their multiple needs. Despite the importance of women’s consumption patterns there is no precise information in this regard. Thus the main purpose of this study is to investigate the parameters of status consumption and role-relaxed consumption as well as to study the effect of personal and social factors, inclination to be unique, to be impressed by others, and to notice the social comparison information on status oriented consumption and role-relaxed consumption. 
This is a descriptive study conducted through a survey. The statistical population of the study is girl students of university of Isfahan. The sample size was estimated to be 369 and data gathering has been done by classified random sampling. The data gathering instrument was questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents’ consumption pattern complies with the status consumption, also personal factors (tendency to uniqueness) have positive effect on status consumption and social factors (consumers’ susceptibility to interpersonal influence and attention to social comparison information) have negative effect on role-relaxed consumption.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The survey was conducted by the random classification sampling and the data was collected through a questionnaire in the year 1388. The Askanzvny Conflict Theory has been used in this research to show the relationship between the sexual satisfaction of women and conflicts between spouses. The result of this survey showed that there is a significant and reverse relationship between the sexual satisfaction of women and conflicts between spouses. So with the rise of women's sexual satisfaction, couples’ conflicts will reduce. Furthermore the first three aspects out of the fivefold aspects of sexual satisfaction have reverse relationship with the conflict between spouses.]]></dcterms:abstract>
