This study was an attempt to predict the academic achievement of the students of Imam Ali Military University students based on thinking styles. For this purpose and also in an attempt to assess the thinking styles, the study was conducted through administering Sternberg and Wagner thinking styles questionnaire among a sample of 705 students affiliated to the Imam Ali Military University who were selected based on stratified random sampling method. To conduct this study, in terms of making measurement of the students’ academic achievement, data collection procedures were run through utilizing correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression methods. The findings revealed that in terms of thinking styles including hierarchical, global, external, legislative, and judicial, there is a significant positive relationship among thinking styles, type I thinking styles and the students’ academic achievement. Meanwhile, there is a significant negative relationship between internal thinking styles and students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, the findings of stepwise regression analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient of multiple regression between thinking styles and students’ academic achievement releasing 0.19. Moreover, in terms of academic achievement variance, the thinking styles including legislative (type I), local (type II) and external (type III) releasing 3.7% of academic achievement variance. The findings of data analysis of freshman and sophomore also revealed that the correlation coefficient of multiple regressions between thinking styles and students’ academic achievement releasing 0.29 and 0.28 respectively. Moreover, in terms of the academic achievement variance of freshman and sophomore, the thinking styles including global and hierarchical releasing 8.2% and external thinking style releasing 7.4% respectively. Meanwhile in juniors, there was no significant relationship between thinking styles and academic achievement.</abstract>

			<abstract>Abstract Making decisions as to how to make an investment in modern technologies is taken as the crucial necessities of defensive industries in developing countries and this phenomenon attracted a great deal of significance due to the chronic shortage of funds and also huge expenditure on research and technological developments. Moreover, proposing an effective model of technological forecasting is among the main requirements for any structure of defense system and is also identified as a contributing factor especially in designing interactional structures as well as laying the foundation for strategic choices. Meanwhile, a deficient model could lead into the total failure of defensive policies in achieving the pre-identified goals. building Specifications of an effective model of technological forecasting received a great deal of attention in many industrial centers in defense sector and in an attempt to identify these specifications, policy makers and planners have encountered serious questions including how to propose an effective model for technological forecasting and how to identify its specifications. This study was an attempt to identify the effective factors enhancing the capabilities of technological forecasting in defense sector and is also aimed at proposing a comprehensive model for implementing defensive strategies through selecting and developing appropriate and effective technologies. The study was also conducted through library study including analyzing the national policies in defense sectors, exploiting the potential of studies conducted to identify an effective model and also investigating the experienced expert’s consultation and elite interview. Then, some specifications of an effective model for technological forecasting were emerged as a result of library study and expert consultation. Thereupon, in a bid to identify probable result of selecting and applying technological forecasting model, probability analysis was also run in this study. At the final stage of investigation, the effects of the effective components building an effective model of technological forecasting were identified through running probability analysis.</abstract>

			<abstract>maladjustment of some Soldiers is causing enduring concern among commanders in military context. In line with this, solution-focused group counseling is identified as a modern approach in reducing maladjustment of soldiers. This approach is of crucial significance due to the factors including simplicity, short-term treatment, and emphasis on the identification of soldiers as well as utilization of group counseling in group training in military context. As an experimental study including Pretest-Treatment and Posttest, This research aims at investigating the effectiveness of the short-term group counseling on increasing the adjustment of soldiers residing in barracks through utilizing solution-focused approach. For this purpose and also in terms of statistical population, the study was conducted through engaging sample population of 28 soldiers residing in one of the barracks of Iranian armed forces who were selected based on simple random sampling method creating two groups including experimental and control group. Thereupon, adjustment test was administered among participants and they were scored below the average level. For data collection procedures, this study was also conducted through administering Sinha and Singh adjustment questionnaire including 60 components among statistical population. Moreover, the experimental group enjoyed ten eighty-minute sessions of solution-focused group counseling treatment. The findings revealed that solution-focused group counseling can significantly improve the adjustment level including social, emotional and educational adjustment in soldiers residing in the barracks. The findings also revealed that solution-focused group counseling is an effective way of increasing the adjustment level in soldiers. However, soldiers’ maladjustment can be reduced and also prevented in the light of utilizing solution-focused group counseling approach</abstract>
