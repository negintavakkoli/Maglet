Hence, evaluation the effect of individual and environmental factors on job satisfaction of employees in District 18 of Tehran municipality is the main purpose of this research. This is an applied research and data collection did through descriptive survey method. In order to collect primary data, a questionnaire package was used that included 34 questions in Likert scale. Validity of questionnaire was face validity and content validity and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated to assess the reliability that was Equal to 0.881 for pre-test and 0.889 for post-test. The population of the study was all the staff of District 18 of Tehran municipality and 300 questionnaires were distributed among them by Stratified random manner. To do this research, two main hypotheses were developed and analyzed in two ways of descriptive and inferential statistics. In the descriptive analysis, the parameters of frequency, percentage, mean were used and to test the hypothesis of independence of the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and regression analysis were used. The results show a significant positive correlation between environmental factors and job satisfaction there. This data shows that the average job satisfaction of employees is 3.48 and average satisfaction of individual factors and environmental Respectively is equal to 3.77 and 3.14.

			<abstract>
			Today, urbanization is growing in all countries. Increasing urban population growth has led to the development in various fields especially the economy. For example, according to the World Bank's World Development Report 2019, about 16% of world GDP is produced in the 30 cities in the world. But cities development has had many problems such as pollution, noise, traffic, etc. Accordingly many residents of metropolitans see the population growth at the root of their problems And city managers are faced with the question whether there is an optimal size for the city and if there is, what is its limits? In this paper, the optimal and sustainable size of the metropolises of the country has been estimated. Investigated metropolises due to lack of data, only include the cities of Tehran, Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz, in the year 1387 to the year 1391. The method is based on an economic model that has three local economic factors: firms, households and local government. The results showed that the size of Tehran metropolitan has crossed its sustainable and optimal size And metropolises of Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz has passed of optimal size but have a distance to the sustainable size.&#160;

			<abstract>
			With the rapid increase in world population that is concentrated in cities, expansion of suburbs and horizontal spread of cities has been accelerated rapidly and the scale of urban planning crisis in many parts of the world has been expanded. Hence, compact urban development paradigm for achieving sustainability and social justice and space were considered. Accordingly, this paper tries to explain the modality of compact and city-wide development of Yazd with the use of descriptive categories of urban density. The research statistical community is the province of Yazd and Housing and Urban Development organization and the sample size is the total area of the city of Yazd.To collect comprehensive and useful information related to the subject, it was used a questionnaire, field monitoring and visiting. In order to testing the research hypothesizes, investigate the role of variables and obtain the results, it was used SPSS and LISREL software, regression analysis and analysis of variance. According to studies conducted in the years 1385-1345, the area of the city, and its population is about 19 and 5 times increased. During these years the gross population density of the city has been decreased from 131.3 to 34.5 persons per hectare. Severe reduction of the gross density of population, indicating the huge extent of city and remaining urban inactive and empty spaces in the city of Yazd, and finally, the horizontal development and urban extent of Yazd

This instability leads to an urban sustainability in the optimal distribution of urban services and citizen accessibility to the life facilities and increasing the infrastructure expenditures and wasting energy.
