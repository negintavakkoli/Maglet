	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Human is a compatible creature with the ability to grow the modern knowledge and new patterns of activity. Social pressures and cultural norms could affect formation of behavioral patterns and attitudes of urban planners. However, the framework is not static and could be changed over the time and the urban planners are responsible for controlling, conducting and evaluating the reflection of these changes and playing role in their formation. It should be noted that with such speed of changes in the current cities, realization of a degree of flexibility if required and the future prospects could clear flexible and creative cities as the contexts for economic, social and cultural development of societies and urban spaces could be important sites to meet needs of citizens and formation of social activities. Now in this study, which is a descriptive-analytical research in terms of nature, the main objective is to recognize required components in formation of flexible urban space in Iran and to measure the perceptions and expectations of flexible urban spaces in Iran. It should be mentioned that achievement of these spaces with flexibility capabilities needs firstly some preconditions including accessibility, diversity and readability. In this regard, at the first, qualitative data are collected using library method and the literature is reviewed to identify the most important components involved in formation of flexible urban space and then, the data are measured in frame of Delphi Method. Then, to clear the differences between expectations and perceptions, a questionnaire is used for paired mean comparison of components. Due to the difference between the existing and expected conditions, this issue was confirmed. Finally, for better understanding of the difference and using the gap scatter plot, relevant factors of physical system and energy were placed in the part of balanced and fixed factors, factors related to spatial and functional system and meeting needs of citizens as the problem and relevant factors of formation process and role of citizens in growth balance were observed.&lt;/p&gt;
