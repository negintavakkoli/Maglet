	<abstract_fa>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: -40.05pt&quot;&gt;Cities have been consisted of many eroded textures. The renovation designs have been provided due to many problems the residents face with.  These designs are not always successful. Lack of specific pattern or enough experience regarding the intervention in the eroded textures and no suitable and enough attention to the public cooperation are some of the reasons of these designs failure. Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate the intervention in the eroded textures with an overall insight to the experiences of some countries. Paying attention to the social, cultural and economic status of the residents, providing the required infrastructures, paying attention to the ownerships, and promoting the public cooperation level are the important indices in most of the renovation designs. The purpose of the present research is to study the role of renovation and reconstruction in the world`s eroded textures descriptively. The experience of other countries have different ways of modernizing the social, economic, cultural and especially provided in partnership with samples being analyzed and then a series solution is given in the form of recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
