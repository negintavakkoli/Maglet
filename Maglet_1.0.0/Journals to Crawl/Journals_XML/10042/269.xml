	<abstract language="eng">Nowadays, irregular horizontal expansion of the cities is one of the nation&#8217;s major problems, having been given way to as a result of ever-increasing importance attached to the cities and their population concentration. The problems of the cities are the intertwined structural, economic, social, and environmental factors resulting from irregular horizontal expansion. However, despite difficulties, it should be reiterated that the horizontal expansion of the cities is indispensable. The current research is descriptive-analytical and has investigated and analyzed spatial-structural expansion of the city of Qazvin as well as land-use changes in it. Evaluating the process of physical expansion of the city and being aware of models of land-use changes and making use of the obtained results are important in the city&#8217;s future planning. Regarding the fact that, currently, Remote Sensing technique is the best method of monitoring environmental changes and identifying land-uses, which also enjoys the highest speed and the most accuracy, the current research has used the images of Landsat from 1986 to 2011, having been evaluated and analyzed via satellite-images processing techniques and GIS. The results indicate that the constructed area of the city of Qazvin has increased from 1645.29 Hectares in 1986 to 3428.73 Hectares in 2011. According to Holdern Model, such an increase is mainly due to population factor (%58.36) and unbalanced urban expansion factor (%41.64), which are among the important factors in land-use changes in the very city.&#160;</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">There is a significantly strong relationship between identifying the worn-out city texture and urban sustainable development thus, the current article aimed at investigation the extent of relationship between the indices of identifying the worn-out textures and those of sustainable development in the area around the holy shrine of Imam Reza (PBUH) through Canonical Correlation Analysis in order to determine the covariance of the two mentioned varied groups. To this end, via survey method and researcher-developed questionnaire, the required data were collected from such three groups as group A, i.e. the owners whose property is out of texture (n= 201), group B, i.e. those who are transferring their property (n=70), and group C, other property owners (n=170) and the collected date were statistically analyzed by means of the software Statistica 8. The results obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that there is a proper linear link between the set of canonical variables. While in groups A and B, the index of texture unsustainability (X1) with an amount equal to -0.65 and in group C, the index of impassability (X2) reduced with an amount equal to -0.96, in group A, the household economic index (Y3), in group B, technical-structural index (Y1), and in group C, economic index (Y3) increase to the amount 0.59, 0.77, and 0.87, respectively. Therefore, the results show that the indices of texture identification, both sustainability- and impassability-wise, enjoy better concordance with the increase or decrease in the indices of economic and structural-technical sustainable development, and comparing with other canonical variables, play much more role in the first Canonical Correlation Coefficient, i.e. in the quality of urban sustainable development around the holy shrine.&#160;</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">The current research aims at restoring old neighborhoods with a new-urbanism approach in the old texture of the city of Rasht, i.e. Sagharisazan Neighborhood. The research method was descriptive-analytical and of field research methods, questionnaire technique and also library research were utilized. At first, theoretical underpinnings of the study in two sections of old textures and new urbanism are explicated. Then, following devising strategic planning process, situational territory of the study in environmental, historical, social, economic, and structural sections is investigated. Next, the vision, missions, and macro- and micro-objectives of the neighborhood are developed, and, then, utilizing SWOT technique, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are analyzed and according to the evaluation matrix of internal and external factors, the strategies for neighborhood restoration are worked out. Eventually, Sagharisazan Neighborhood is investigated with regard to the principles of new-urbanism, planning, strategies, and operational plans. The results indicate that 57 percent of the residents opted for taking loans from banks for restoration and only 8 percent of them agree with aggregation approach. Besides, the satisfaction level of more than 50 percent of the residents was at low or very low level. Lack of green area and inappropriate width of the passageways were among the main problems the residents pointed to.&#160;</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Nowadays, small cities take an important role in population distribution, identical and fair distribution of social and economic activities, reducing regional inequalities, and finally, regional equilibrium, and equality in urban-regional system. The current research aims at analyzing the role of small-sized cities in regional equilibrium of urban network of East Azerbaijan Province. The research type is applied-developmental and the population was all the cities of the province. The required data was collected from the population and housing census from 1956-2011, Iran Statistics Center, Governorship, Statistical and Census Annals, and different bureaus and organizations. Moreover, to determine the extent of systemic equilibrium of the region such quantitative models as Rank-Size, Entropy Coefficient, Primate City Index, Elasticity Coefficient, Shift Share, and Location Quotient were made use of. In 2011, East Azerbaijan Province included five small-sized cities with population of 25000-50000, constituting 0.075 population of urban network of the region. The results indicated that, upon Rank-Size model, from 1986-2011, lack of equilibrium in urban hierarchy of East Azerbaijan Province was readily observable. Besides, investigating main agricultural, industrial, and service activities in small-sized cities indicated that such cities, in service section, import their demands and the only exceptions are the cities of Sarab and Azarshahr, agriculture-wise. The cities of Ajabshir and Sardroud import all their demands in all aspects and have failed to take a proper role in regional system equilibrium. Therefore, injecting capital and facilities into small cities may be a proper solution for reducing regional inequality, population concentration, and industry in the metropolis of Tabriz and finally it can bring about relative equilibrium in the regional system of East Azerbaijan Province.&#160;</abstract>
