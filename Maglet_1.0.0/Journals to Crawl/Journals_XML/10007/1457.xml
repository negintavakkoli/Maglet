Symbolic realism has been discussed as a realistic technique in art and literature style within this through this method, realism and symbolism make contradictory link where although symbolic relationships are formed but signifier, arbitrary signified as well as secondary all have realistic approach in this link which mean in context realistic channel as well as receiver's experimental mind connection with that, although culture, society, policy, history, myths and legends are also represented but they aren&amp;rsquot determinant of meaning and only can be crystallized in second half discovery of signifier as receiver&amp;rsquos mental reserves and of course this is the result and related to discussed realistic patterns in work. This research is sought to investigate symbolic realism which is a kind of realism that is used as technique in a work and can be one of its style indicators and considered as main style in case of its extent of function in work. Besides structural investigation of &quot;symbolic realism&quot;, history, approach as well as introducing its artists and writers are investigated in this research and has explained rout map for further researches in this field not only in literature field but also in architecture, painting as well as religious issues. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
