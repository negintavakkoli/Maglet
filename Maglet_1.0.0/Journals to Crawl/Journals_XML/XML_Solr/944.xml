Such a change is manifested in a new level of economy referred to as “experience economy”,   by Pine and Gilmore (1999), according to which such economy is the final phase of economic growth which is a more evolved phase of raw materials (in agricultural economy), of goods (in industrial economy), and services (in service-based economy). In experience economy, the consumer is client which is known as guest. The final product is a mix of goods, services, and experiences which give way to added value to the guest. Pine and Gilmore in their 4E Model, upon two aspects of the extent of participation (active/passive) and the degree of the guest interaction with the environment (absorption/immersion), made a distinction between four dimensions namely entertainment, education, a esthetics, and escapism. Inasmuch as the important issue of teen tourism has not been well accounted for in Iranian references and academic research, the current research has aimed at investigating into a case upon the 4E model in the perceptual context of the teenagers. The data were collected via library research, to shape the theoretical framework, and by means of observation and interview with 25 experts in teen tourism, as well as through a questionnaire developed based on Bogardus scale. The population included 560 male and female students of high schools in the city of Tehran. Utilizing SPSS and Excel software, the collected data were classified and analyzed. The results show that the students prefer to be completely immersed in nature while they prefer the a esthetic dimension in historical texture.</field></doc></add>
