	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Spatial and social inequalities are universal and expanding phenomenon. Identification and spatial analysis of social, economic and ecological inequalities in metropolises is one of the essential and basic proceeding for planning and achieving urban sustainable development. The present research method is descriptive-analytical and using 13 sub criteria based on three main criteria of social, economic and environmental analyzes the status of spatial fragmentation among the metropolis Tehran's districts. For this purpose, the criteria and sub- criteria's internal and external dependencies was determined using the Delphi and ANP method in Super Decisions Software and assessed and scored relative to each other. The results of  assessing the indicators shows that Tehran metropolis lacks of the physical unity and spatial heterogeneity between the north and south of the city remains as main feature of its spatial structure. It is necessary that the authorities of Tehran urban management to take actions for better understanding of this phenomenon and consequently offer new and efficient solutions for reducing the effects of various impacts of spatial inequality and duality.  For this reason, it is essential to rethink the concept of city in terms of social, economic, political, and ecological and sustainability dimensions&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
