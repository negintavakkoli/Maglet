With an increase in the number of service providers in urban services section, the related companies and organizations have been involved in a competition to increase quality and derive customers’ satisfaction and take the most from the market. The current research study aims at introducing a self-assessment model playing an effective role in increasing such organizations’ customer-satisfaction. From among the auditors of the organizations for urban services in the city of Tehran, as the population of the study, 70 were randomly selected.
