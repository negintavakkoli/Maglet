	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Historical fabric of Arak, as one of the most important inorganic cities in urbanization history of Iran, has been implemented from the beginning based on predetermined plan and project. During the age that majority of cities in Iran used to be created organically and gradually based on public needs, all steps of construction of Arak City including spatial organization, physical structure, communicative network system, activity distribution pattern and composition of urban elements were firstly designed and then implemented. The main objective of this study is to identify and analyze the physical features of monuments of Arak city to discover the behavioral system of monuments with the composition features standard. According to the research objective, the method applied is descriptive, analytical and comparative method based on field and library investigations. In this study, first architectural composition features including scale, proportion, hierarchy, axis, focus point, composition center, modulus, flexibility, rhythm and geometry are analyzed in each monument. Then, the monuments were classified in sub-factors of each composition feature and then, through comparing the classified groups, common features of monuments in each sub-factor with most frequency are extracted. The results obtained from the study showed existence of unit behavioral system in special groups of monuments compared to architectural composition features leading to typology of Arak&amp;rsquo;s historical monuments.&lt;/p&gt;
