			<abstract>Nowadays, organizations acknowledged the importance of social capital and its role to develop organizational and human resources. On the other hand, organizational forgetting is a new concept drawing the researchers &#039;attention. The present descriptive- survey study aims to explain the relationship between social capital and organizational forgetting. 200 staff of university of Isfahan were selected as sample by using Sample Power software. Two questionnaires of social capital and organizational forgetting were used as research tools. Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate regression were used in this research. The results suggested that, there is a positive and significant relationship between social capital and intentional organizational forgetting, while a negative and significant relationship exists between social capital and accidental organizational forgetting. Data analysis showed a positive and significant relationship between social capital and organizational forgetting, that is, by using social capital, individuals can participate in decision making, so that they accept and implement the forgetting plan with awareness and confidence to its goals. This acceptance leads to decrease in resistance toward changes, decrease in knowledge waste, enhancement of absorption coefficient in organizations, development of stored knowledge, and finally improvement of organization.</abstract>

			<abstract>This study aims to examine the effect of ambidextrous leadership on work attitudes in which the moderating role of social capital and self-efficacy were considered as well. Research method is of descriptive- correctional surveys. Statistical population consisted 1520 employees of Telecommunications Infrastructure Company which a random sample of them was selected which consisted 307 employees. Data were collected via questionnaires that have been used in previous researches. Collected data were analyzed according to structural equation modeling using AMOS software. Results show that ambidextrous leadership has a positive effect on job satisfaction and emotional commitment as the main work attitudes. Meanwhile, findings show that social capital and self-efficacy play the moderating roles in this relationship. Therefore, ambidextrous leadership behaviors would have greater positive effect on employees` work attitudes if they enjoy social capital and self-efficacy.</abstract>

The importance of maintaining these companies in competitive environments has made marketing a vital part of them. Therefore, the social capital of the manager / staff in these businesses can be an incentive for the proper use of entrepreneurial marketing for the development and improvement of these firms, and since the use of entrepreneurial marketing requires rich and multifaceted knowledge, knowledge sharing can be a tool for improvement. This research studies the home-based businesses in Isfahan province. For data analysis, structural equation modeling and Smart PLS 2 software have been used. The results indicate that the existence of social capital is predictive of the use of entrepreneurial marketing dimensions in these businesses. It was also found that higher levels of social capital could increase the likelihood of knowledge sharing. And finally, the promotion of knowledge sharing culture can be a stimulus to employ entrepreneurial marketing.</abstract>

			<abstract>For some years now, the phenomenon of brain drain in developing countries, and especially in the countries of the Middle East, has attracted the attention of economists. According to economic theories about the economic consequences of brain drain, there are two traditional views. The traditional view of brain drain is considered as a direct reduction of human capital, but in the new perspective, in addition to those considered in traditional perspectives, the positive effects of brain drain are also considered. The main reason for the discussion here is the positive role of brain drain in increasing the motivation to acquire education in the community, the transfer of knowledge and technology through the return of short-term immigration, the formation of the effects of immigration networks and returning income to countries of origin versus The negative impact of brain drain is the reduction of human capital in the country of origin. Therefore, in this research, the clarity of the importance and importance of the effects of brain drain on human capital accumulation, as well as judgments about the traditional and modern perspectives on the brain drain literature in Middle Eastern countries during the period 1991-2010, has been addressed. The results of the study show that the brain drain has a positive effect on the accumulation of human capital in the studied countries and at existing rates of brain drain, 9 countries benefited from brain drain and 5 affected countries. In addition, considering that Iran is suffering from brain drain, it is suggested that by creating favorable conditions for the elites, it is suggested that their survival coefficient in the country be provided.</abstract>
