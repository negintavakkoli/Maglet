Case study: pars oil and Gas Company}, 
abstract ={The present paper intends to study socialization and its relationship with the newly recruited employees' intention to leave. The data have been collected out of 171 statistical samples from Pars oil and Gas Company located in Assaluye. This Company employed nearly 1200 university graduates in 2011-2012. Interviews as well as questionnaire have been used as data collection instruments. Thus two standard questionnaires of socialization and employees' intention to leave are used, the validity and reliability of which have been proven.&#160;Spearman correlation test in SPSS has been selected to analyze the statistical data. The results indicate that there is a meaningful negative relationship between socialization and its fourfold classification including training, organizational perception, company's support and its future prospects with employees' intention to leave. Addition, the results demonstrate that there is no meaningful difference between regular and highly talented employees concerning intention to leave.},

abstract ={&#160; Despite the fact that human resource strategic management enjoys a worldwide maturity, it is an emergent realm of study in Iran. This novel management approach, similar to a many modern management concepts and practices, is only used in managers' diction, and as unconventional technical jargon. Aligned with the significance associated with this area and feel the need to Assess human resource management system of National Iranian Oil Company and analyze the gap between the present condition and the desirable one, the &#8220;5P&#8221; Model of strategic human resource management (Schuler, 1992) selected and according to parameters of the model the study has been designed and conducted. The sample to this study has been drawn by random selection of subjects from human resources departments' administrative staff in main and subsidiary companies of National Iranian Oil Company. While study's researcher-developed questionnaire's internal reliability was determined via experts' consensus, its structural reliability was confirmed through factor analysis. Besides, its internal consistency was measured through Cronbach's Alpha coefficient. The findings, in line with previous evaluations of the studied model, have revealed its being highly-welcomed and apposite to National Iranian Oil Company's structure. National Iranian's Oil Company's low average score for the five activities of the model, including philosophies; policies; programs; practices; and processes, indicates the significant existing gap between Company's current condition and the desirable one, it; thus, implies the fact that these five are not aligned with Company's strategic needs. Moreover, it verifies the effect of internal and external environmental factors over Company's main strategies aiming at creating strategic needs. The findings, in line with previous evaluations of the studied model, have revealed its being highly-welcomed and apposite to National Iranian Oil Company's structure. Ultimately and in accordance with study's findings, some implications have been offered seeking to improve and enhance the present human resource management system, besides approaching goals of human resource strategic management in National Iranian Oil Company.},

In order to examine the relationship between individual factors and productivity, the Pearson correlation test was used. Moreover, regression analysis used to examine the effects of individual factors on labor productivity. The results showed that among the individual factors , three factors such as skills, job satisfaction and job security have a significant relationship with labor productivity but motivation don't have a significant relationship with labor productivity. Relationship between personality and productivity is significant only in terms of level of education and in groups of Master's Degree and above. Regression analysis showed that approximately 36% of the variation in the dependent variable depends on the three correlated individual factors.},

In order to determine the reliability of the survey, Test-Retest method is used whose results signify 84% correlation between answers. In this study, 12 factors have been analyzed as effective factors on corporate entrepreneurship. The findings of this research demonstrate that the effective factors on corporate entrepreneurship can be categorized into two groups; driver factors or causes which are generally related to human resource management and dependent factors or effects which are totally related to organizational culture and structure. Driver factors have a greater effect on the promotion of corporate entrepreneurship and can provide a proper background for the achievement of dependent factors.},
