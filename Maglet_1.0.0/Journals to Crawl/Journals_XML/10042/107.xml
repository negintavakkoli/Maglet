			<abstract>
			Mehr housing project is one of the large-scale developmental projects which commenced with the aim of easing housing shortage of the fellow countrymen, while spending a huge amount of financial, physical, and a large number of human resources. Now, measuring the extent of the relative efficiency of this project is an appropriate index for its evaluation. Thus, in the current research, the extent of the efficiency of the cities of Sistan and Balouchestan Province with population of more than 25000 in implementing Mehr housing projects over the period of 2008-2011 was measured utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Technique via output-based BCC model. The variables, used as input, were human resources and physical and financial resources, and the outputs were the number of finished buildings and the extent of employment resulting from such a project. The results indicate that Mehr housing project was efficient in such cities as Chabahar, Khash, Zahedan, and Konarak and inefficient in Iranshahr, Zabol, and Saravan.&#160;

			<abstract>
			Nowadays, irregular horizontal expansion of the cities is one of the nation&#8217;s major problems, having been given way to as a result of ever-increasing importance attached to the cities and their population concentration. The problems of the cities are the intertwined structural, economic, social, and environmental factors resulting from irregular horizontal expansion. However, despite difficulties, it should be reiterated that the horizontal expansion of the cities is indispensable. The current research is descriptive-analytical and has investigated and analyzed spatial-structural expansion of the city of Qazvin as well as land-use changes in it. Evaluating the process of physical expansion of the city and being aware of models of land-use changes and making use of the obtained results are important in the city&#8217;s future planning. Regarding the fact that, currently, Remote Sensing technique is the best method of monitoring environmental changes and identifying land-uses, which also enjoys the highest speed and the most accuracy, the current research has used the images of Landsat from 1986 to 2011, having been evaluated and analyzed via satellite-images processing techniques and GIS. The results indicate that the constructed area of the city of Qazvin has increased from 1645.29 Hectares in 1986 to 3428.73 Hectares in 2011. According to Holdern Model, such an increase is mainly due to population factor (%58.36) and unbalanced urban expansion factor (%41.64), which are among the important factors in land-use changes in the very city.&#160;

			<abstract>
			There is a significantly strong relationship between identifying the worn-out city texture and urban sustainable development thus, the current article aimed at investigation the extent of relationship between the indices of identifying the worn-out textures and those of sustainable development in the area around the holy shrine of Imam Reza (PBUH) through Canonical Correlation Analysis in order to determine the covariance of the two mentioned varied groups. To this end, via survey method and researcher-developed questionnaire, the required data were collected from such three groups as group A, i.e. the owners whose property is out of texture (n= 201), group B, i.e. those who are transferring their property (n=70), and group C, other property owners (n=170) and the collected date were statistically analyzed by means of the software Statistica 8. The results obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that there is a proper linear link between the set of canonical variables. While in groups A and B, the index of texture unsustainability (X1) with an amount equal to -0.65 and in group C, the index of impassability (X2) reduced with an amount equal to -0.96, in group A, the household economic index (Y3), in group B, technical-structural index (Y1), and in group C, economic index (Y3) increase to the amount 0.59, 0.77, and 0.87, respectively. Therefore, the results show that the indices of texture identification, both sustainability- and impassability-wise, enjoy better concordance with the increase or decrease in the indices of economic and structural-technical sustainable development, and comparing with other canonical variables, play much more role in the first Canonical Correlation Coefficient, i.e. in the quality of urban sustainable development around the holy shrine.&#160;

			<abstract>
			Thanks to such important islands as Kish and Qeshm, Iran has gained a strategic position in the Persian Gulf therefore, analyzing the economic and developmental role of such regions seems important in the regional development of the nation. The current article aims at investigating and analyzing the role of Qeshm in regional development. The research is applied, type-wise, and the data were collected from the results of the last population and housing census in 2011. The research method was descriptive- analytical wherein Location Quotient model, Elasticity Index, Izard Longitudinal Data Analysis, and the methods of Georges Chabot and Tony Garnier were utilized. The results show that Qeshm is self-dependant in service section and the real rate of employment is 91.84 percent and the orientation of the island is commerce and trading. Upon the Izard method, Qeshm Island is generally above the average level of the region in the three sections of economy however, it is below average on national scale. Therefore, attaining a better position at national and regional level requires devising and implementing strategic plans and that the nation&#8217;s decision makers pay special attention to unique potentials of the very island

			<abstract>
			The current research aims at restoring old neighborhoods with a new-urbanism approach in the old texture of the city of Rasht, i.e. Sagharisazan Neighborhood. The research method was descriptive-analytical and of field research methods, questionnaire technique and also library research were utilized. At first, theoretical underpinnings of the study in two sections of old textures and new urbanism are explicated. Then, following devising strategic planning process, situational territory of the study in environmental, historical, social, economic, and structural sections is investigated. Next, the vision, missions, and macro- and micro-objectives of the neighborhood are developed, and, then, utilizing SWOT technique, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are analyzed and according to the evaluation matrix of internal and external factors, the strategies for neighborhood restoration are worked out. Eventually, Sagharisazan Neighborhood is investigated with regard to the principles of new-urbanism, planning, strategies, and operational plans. The results indicate that 57 percent of the residents opted for taking loans from banks for restoration and only 8 percent of them agree with aggregation approach. Besides, the satisfaction level of more than 50 percent of the residents was at low or very low level. Lack of green area and inappropriate width of the passageways were among the main problems the residents pointed to.&#160;

			<abstract>
			Iran&#8217;s social and cultural conditions and changes and the importance of trust in citizens&#8217; social interactions over the recent years have foregrounded the issue of probing the extent of trust in individuals, groups, and organizations. Urban management, particularly municipality, as one of the largest social institutions, can enjoy much more efficiency and productivity provided that it wins citizens&#8217; trust, as social and intangible capital, utilizing it for actualizing organizational purposes and urban development. Due to the fact that urban management, as the section responsible for managing cities, is one of the integral parts of modernity, investigating the extent of trust in this domain bears significant importance. The major theme of the current research is evaluating and ranking the districts of Tehran municipality according to the extent of social trust in urban management upon Fuzzy Topsis method. The research population was the 22 districts of the city of Tehran and the samples were at least the 18-year-olds residing the city. Utilizing Cochran formula, sample size was estimated and to ensure accuracy of the data, 400 participants were involved from the very districts and according to the ratio of the population of each district through Cluster sampling method. To collect data, a quadripartite questionnaire, the validity and reliability of which were found to be significant, was utilized.&#160; The results indicate that the residents of the district 11 of Tehran municipality are ranked first in the extent of trust in urban management among the other districts.&#160;

			<abstract>
			Nowadays, small cities take an important role in population distribution, identical and fair distribution of social and economic activities, reducing regional inequalities, and finally, regional equilibrium, and equality in urban-regional system. The current research aims at analyzing the role of small-sized cities in regional equilibrium of urban network of East Azerbaijan Province. The research type is applied-developmental and the population was all the cities of the province. The required data was collected from the population and housing census from 1956-2011, Iran Statistics Center, Governorship, Statistical and Census Annals, and different bureaus and organizations. Moreover, to determine the extent of systemic equilibrium of the region such quantitative models as Rank-Size, Entropy Coefficient, Primate City Index, Elasticity Coefficient, Shift Share, and Location Quotient were made use of. In 2011, East Azerbaijan Province included five small-sized cities with population of 25000-50000, constituting 0.075 population of urban network of the region. The results indicated that, upon Rank-Size model, from 1986-2011, lack of equilibrium in urban hierarchy of East Azerbaijan Province was readily observable. Besides, investigating main agricultural, industrial, and service activities in small-sized cities indicated that such cities, in service section, import their demands and the only exceptions are the cities of Sarab and Azarshahr, agriculture-wise. The cities of Ajabshir and Sardroud import all their demands in all aspects and have failed to take a proper role in regional system equilibrium. Therefore, injecting capital and facilities into small cities may be a proper solution for reducing regional inequality, population concentration, and industry in the metropolis of Tabriz and finally it can bring about relative equilibrium in the regional system of East Azerbaijan Province.&#160;
