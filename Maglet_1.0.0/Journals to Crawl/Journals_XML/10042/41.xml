title = {Prioritization of Management Indexes of Municipal Solid Waste in Line with Sustainable Development (Case Study: City of Bokan)}, 
abstract ={Non-systematic management of municipal solid waste prepares the ground for the creation of human and environmental problems in long run. Therefore, sustainable and effective municipal waste management strategy is needed to balance the development, quality of life and environment. This paper has been developed to evaluate the management indicators of municipal solid waste in accordance with sustainable development in Bukan by using TOPIS technique. Research method is survy (questionnaire and field study) and describtive- analytical data analysis was used. The statistical population was the city&#8217;s population of 171,773 people with the sample of 384 people. It was reduced to 330 due to the limitations of the study. Findings show that 150 tons of waste are produced daily on average in the city of Bukan and the waste per capita is 0.740 kg per day. The most amount of produced solid waste is related to organic materials with 75.82 and the least amount is related to wood with 0.65 percent. The final obtained ranking of satisfaction rate of sustainable development indexes of solid waste management by TOPSIS method has indicated that the factor of tip request was in the first rank and the factor of advertisement attractiveness was in the 20th rank that is the least important one.},

abstract ={Currently, old textures are one of the main problems in many cities and even villages in our country. The specific feature of these textures makes it necessary to be considered from different aspects. This study is trying to find strategies to improve and organize old texture in the Shahidgah neighborhood of Ardabil. It also aims to plan and design in accordance with the existing status and consistent with strategic priorities. In this regard, using review of documents and field surveys, existing status of the neighborhood were evaluated using SWOT analysis and planning strategies. Continuing with the quantitative models used, organizing strategies are prioritized. Finally, five design alternatives presented in accordance with texture requirements. Findings indicate that the organizing of the studied area should adopt a systematic approach for 4 dimensions of physical, economic, social and environmental interventions to deal with. The preferred alternative has tried to organize and remove the ruined buildings in the middle of the area, a closeness be created and the central space is used to create a neighborhood center.},

title = {An Analysis on the Price of Urban Land in Iranâ€™s Provinces during 2001 to 2011}, 
abstract ={Attention to land, as one of the principal and renewable sources in urban sustainable development, is a necessary task since it is considered as one of the main sources of urban sustainable development. The purpose of this research is an analysis on the price of urban land in different provinces of Iran during 2001 to 2011. The research method is documentary and library techinque was used for data collection. PASW, GeoDa, and GIS soft wares were used for data analysis. Research findings indicate random distribution of urban land price during 2001 to 2011 in different provinces. According to Enter regression test, it was specified that there is no significant relationship between the variables of urbanization percentage and the average of land area of urban buildings with the price of urban land in 2001, but there was a significant relationship between these variables in 2006 and 2011. However, there is a significant relationship between development level of provinces and the price of urban land in 2011 in some provinces at the level of 95 percent. After studying the changes in the average price of urban land of Iran&#8217;s provinces during 2001 to 2011, it was specified that the average coefficient of variation of urban land price was equal to 827.73 and Bushehr, Khorasan Razavi, and Hamedan provinces had the highest coefficient of variation and Kordestan, Hormozgan, and Khuzestan provinces had the least.},

abstract ={In the last few decades, the relationship between economic infrastructures, particularly transport sector, and economic growth has been the subject of many reserachers in different economies. Iran has many advantages considering particular geographic situation in terms of transport facilities as it connects many countries. In this study, the relationship among ground transport, economic growth, capital formation , and work force was examined by using quarterly data during 1992 to 2012. Required data were extracted from the statistics of Centeral Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran and yearbooks of Statistical Center of Iran. The most important difference of this study compared to other previous studies is using wavelet neural network method and non-linear approach in explaining the relationship among discussed variables. The results of causal relationship test between variables imply the existence of causality from ground transport to economic growth.},

title = {The Role of Informal Jobs in Relieving Informal Settlement (Case Study: Hesaramir of Pakdasht)}, 
abstract ={New theories in empowerment have been focused on the role of spontaneous solutions of suburbanites in the recent years. One of the scientific strategies that inhabitants of informal settlements use for solving the problems of marginalization is to choose informal economy and spontaneous jobs. This research has descriptive-analytical approach emphasizing on questionnaire in order to study the role of such occupations as a solution arisen from these societies in order to relieve the issue of informal settlement among informal habitats of Hesaramir in Pakdasht. Cochran Formula was used to determine sample size. 25303 people of total population of Hesaramir were considered as a statistical population; therefore, 378 people were selected. SWOT technique indicated that development of spontaneous jobs in the informal settlements of Hesaramir of Pakdasht has very high strengths (3.33 scores in terms of internal factors and 3.34 scores in terms of external factors). One sample t tests and chi-square were used to analyze the questionnaires. Chi-square test results showed that there is a significant relationship between the gender of the studied people and tendency to spontaneous jobs with the probability of 95%. T and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to show the impact of spontaneous jobs on economic recovery. The results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicate that tendency to such jobs has leaded to the improvement of economic situation. T-test indicates the significance level less than 0.05 showing the impact of these jobs on the improvement of economic situation.},
