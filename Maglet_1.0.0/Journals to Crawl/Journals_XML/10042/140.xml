			<abstract>
			In addition to have some benefits for the users, private vehicles as a one of urban transportation systems, impose different costs and effects on environment and citizens who are not among users of private cars. Currently, only a small share of car prices is received as the annual tax of car ownership by the municipality, therefore it is necessary to review the process and the external car costs generated by vehicles, has been internalized. In this research, after the study of determining trends of the tax in other countries, and identification the affecting factors in determination the car use tax using factor analysis, we tried to provide a model to internalize the external costs, in order to increase sustainable revenues for urban management and optimize urban economy trends. Finally we tried to use know factors in a mathematical functions to calculate a proportional amount to the external costs generated by vehicles in a way that this proposed amount could be able to increase sustainable revenues for urban management and persuade citizens to use low-pollutant vehicles. The main suggestion of this research is to begin the process of increasing the dependence of urban economy and management of metropolitans Municipalities to unsustainable income resources such as building density and replacing them with scientific and sustainable incomes.

			<abstract>
			Increase in urban population and, the growth and spread of physical and social dimensions of cities has a significant impact on urban life, so that nowadays the concept of cities without regarding green spaces and its various forms is unthinkable. Hence the main objective of this research is to improve the quality of green space in the city of Miyaneh. This Research In terms of the target is an applied research and In terms of method is a descriptive-analytical research. After identifying the components effective and factors on the planning of urban green space, these indicators in four areas were evaluated in the Miyaneh. The target population of this research is all the users of parks and green spaces in the city center, in the months of August, September and October 1391. Then by Using Cochran formula, 383 questionnaires with regard to the scale and reach within the park were distributed randomly. Data was gathered by using the study of literature, documentary method and interview with 10 experts who were familiar to the research subject. Using hierarchical analysis process (AHP), the relative importance of each of these indexes has been set the existing. Parks and green spaces, due to the factors considered were evaluated and through identifying shortcomings, deficiencies and required levels for planning the green spaces in the Miyaneh, some optimal solutions were provided. Based on the results, the physical component, has the largest relative importance among other factors and also environmental, social and economic components are in secondary grade. As well as 3 urban areas have the most difficult situation in green space, so it should be a priority in the planning and construction of urban green spaces

			<abstract>
			Bus transportation has a significant stand in facing urban transports, especially in Metropolitans. One of the steps taken in the area of bus services in Tehran in recent years, is the transference many services of lines to the private sector. This study seek to determine the effects of privatization on providing bus services in Tehran metropolitan. The importance of Extremist bus lines in mobility and better access to information systems, led this experimental study to carry out within these lines. To a experimental study, we compared the performance of lines 1 and 2 (state lines) and line 7 (private line), during the years 1389 to 1391 using the quarterly data. The most widely used method in this type of study, is data envelopment analysis. The results showed that the relative deficiency of line 7 in comparison to the state lines that from the point of kind of managerial deficiency and scale deficiency which scale deficiency was more intensive. Also the deficiency of private line in the output of passengers' transportation was further than output of travelled kilometres. Therefore, based on the research findings, it seems to entrance the private motivations into bus transit services in ways followed, have negative results.

			<abstract>
			Today, with the increasing use of cars and intense traffic and pollution in cities, sustainable urban transport has become one of the main concerns of managers and urban planners. So identification the patterns of travel is one of requirements to achieve the sustainable transport management. One aspect of travel is the number of daily trips and identification of the factors affecting it. The main objective of this study was to identify factors affecting the number of intercity trips in Tehran. In order to achieve the desired goal, the Multivariate Method and Poisson regression models were used. in order to present the traffic policies and socio-economic factors affecting on the number of intercity trips, first 2 neighborhood that located in the odd and even traffic plan were chosen and then were compared to a third neighborhood (Qeytarieh) that was located on the outside of those neighborhood 450 questionnaires were distributed in this areas according to Cochran formula and Morgan table. The results show that: Socio-economic variables (gender, age, education, income, owning a car in the household, type of household, type of job and having a child under 12 years), had the greatest impact on the number of business trips, While in excursions and trips to shopping, the variable of Location relative to the traffic patterns, was more effective.

			<abstract>
			Appropriate decision making about site selection for Residential Units by managers of cities, Housing construction companies, and recreational and educational centers, is required to understand the preferences of households in the area. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing the choice of residential location and measuring the impacts of these factors on probability of the choice. For this purpose, the multinomial logit model was used, and different city areas were classified based on the value of real estate transactions. Then, we sampled from categories randomly based on residential density. Totally 383 households were sampled. The results showed that the household economic factors included income, price, Rent housing units, household, being House or apartment, access to recreational and educational centers, time and costs of transportation are the main determining factors. The results of this study proved that. the behavior and preferences of families in different neighborhoods is not the same. for example, the increase in prices and rents in neighborhoods with low trading value, have a negative effect on the selections, but in neighborhoods with higher trading value, it means the improvement of the quality of housing, and increased the probability if choices. Also The tendency to apartment units in neighborhoods with high trading value, is higher than low-cost areas. Due to differences in the behavior of households in selecting housing units in different neighborhoods by stahttp://iueam.ir/files/0allsites/wysiwyg_en.gifkeholders, influential and relevants, is very important.

			Sustainability is a pattern for thinking about the future in which environmental, social and economic considerations, are in a balanced state with each other, in order to improve the quality of life. Sustainable city is a city in which due to economic use of resources, avoid to producing too much waste and recycling them as much as possible and adopt effective policies, is able to maintain its existence. Training is a helper factor for achieving to sustainability paradigm, especially in the cities, and it is necessary to being consistent to functional assumptions of sustainable development. Training should be changed in structure and in terms of content. This paper aims to identify and understand the role of education in sustainable development, in particular sustainable urban development, and analytic studies relying on documents, including international declarations, to check the status of education in sustainable development, within the framework of international treaties and agreements, conceptual and epistemological aspects that have been investigated. The results show that the concept formulation of the education for sustainable development, by organizations like UNESCO, has properly done. But at the end of the decade of &#8220;education for sustainable development&#8221;, some problems have been remained, particularly in developing countries, therefore The future international efforts in this regard should be directed towards developing countries and cities
