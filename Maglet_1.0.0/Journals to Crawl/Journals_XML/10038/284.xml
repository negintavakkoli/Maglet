				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The purpose of this study is to investigate the landslide hazard in a coastal area of Caspian Seaelongated from Nowshahr to Ramsar. High population density and lack of plains, as well asincreased constructions and architectural and agricultural activities on slopes highlight the necessityof such studies in this area. Landslide distribution map for the area was achieved through fieldstudies. According to these studies, this area has a high potential for landslide incidence, andvarious kinds of Mass wasting can be observed across the area.To analyze landslide hazard in the area, we considered such factors as slope, geology, fault, river,slope aspect, elevation, land use, access routes and shear resistance as effective factors in landslideincidence. Data were digitalized using ArcGIS software and stored as information layers.To develop the Landslide hazard zoning map for the area, method of AHP have been used. The mapthen are classified into five hazard ranges of very low, low, moderate, high and very high.Evaluation of zoning map with regard to landslide density and stable points shows that obtainedmaps hold an acceptable validity.Results analysis shows that slope, geology and fault are among the most important factors involvedin landslide incidence.Developed zoning map can be practical in engineering projects architectural activities in theinvestigated area.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Tabriz city is located in a tectonically active region and on sandy, silty sediments. Because of highlevel ground water in some part of the city, occurrence of liquefaction is probable during strongearthquake. Therefore assessment of mentioned phenomenon is necessary for construction ofinfrastructure. In this paper using standard penetration test (SPT) results, empirical relations andgraphs suggested by NCEER the liquefaction potential of soils in the second line of Tabriz metropath, is assessed. At first by means of corrected SPT values, depth of groundwater and fine contentof soil, the safety factor against liquefaction is calculated. Then using ArcGIS9.3 software theliquefaction potential maps of path alluviums in 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 meters is provided. Basedon assessments, the safety factor against liquefaction in eastern and western part for most regions isgreater than 1. But in central part of the path, there are regions that have safety factor of less than 1and occurrence of liquefaction is probable.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the important problems of municipal management is the corrosion of buried concrete andsteel pipe such as water and Gas pipe and Foundation of structures. The corrosion phenomenaexisted in all type of soils and its severity are related to properties of soil and environment. In thisstudy, the effective parameters on soil corrosive are induced and the surface soil characteristics inMashhad city are investigated. Based on the cumulative effects of five parameters of texture, PH,Cl-, SO4-2 and electric specific strength, the soil corrosive zonation map of Mashhad city areproduced. The data bank includes more than 700 boreholes and the geoelectrical study achieved indifferent projects in the city. The results show that the most surface soil under Mashhad city areaare classified as medium to low corrosive soil and only small part of east, north east and central partof Mashhad city have the high corrosion potential. The high corrosion hazard mainly coincide witharea covered by the demolition and construction soils in bank of streams and out of city in past.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The algorithm of rock mass variation with depth has been proposed on the systematic viewpoint fortunneling in this research. At first, at proposed algorithm, rock mass data has been investigated atdifferent stages of geotechnical studies in a systematic process. Then, collected rock mass data hasbeen classified based on the index parameters of ground behavior. Finally, the ability of depthparameter has been proved for modeling the variation of rock mass characteristics by quantitativeand qualitative method. Therefore, depth dependent variation of rock mass characteristics isapplicable phenomenon for designing the tunnels. Classification of rock mass data based on indexparameters of ground behavior produces the generalization of past results to the similar rock masscondition. Thereupon, geotechnical studies transforms to comprehensive structure havingdetermined final goals which grows the data basics effectively. Performances of proposed algorithmhas been estimated for depth dependency of 11 rock mass characteristics such as: spacing, jointpersistency, joint aperture unconfined compressive strength, elastic modulus, RQD, BRMR, JCR,deformation modulus, rock mass strength and continuity factor in 12 twin tunnels ofKhorrammabad – Pol-e- Zal. According to the results, increase of depth from 50 to more than 250m has been coincident with improvement of rock mass characteristics and joint properties andequivalent continuous rock shifts to range of intact to blocky rock. Therefore, variability of rockmass characteristics with depth has to be considered for designing the support system, excavationmethod and tunneling contracts.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Due to the arching behavior of concrete arch dams, the hydrostatic loads imposed on dam body aretransferred to the abutments. Accordingly, an accurate evaluation of the stability of abutments isvery important. The failure mechanism of abutment is substantially governed by a network ofdiscontinuities crossing the abutment. Meanwhile, the flowing water through discontinuitiesprovides an easier condition for discontinuities to slide and/or open. In this paper, the effects offluid flow and mechanical characteristics of joints are treated on safety of abutments. Though, a full3D simulation of dam body and its surrounding rock mass is needed for a complete understandingof the problem, but in general, the 3D jointed abutment stability analysis considering hydromechanicalinteraction are too time consuming and complicated. Therefore, in this study, a 2-DDEM model for the most critical region of a typical arch dam abutment resulted through a 3D FEmodeling is considered to evaluate the abutment safety. In this research, the effects of fluid flowand mechanical characteristics of joints on the safety are investigated through SRF and increasingwater pressure methods in both dry and saturate assumptions. In order to recognize the conditionsleading to failure in abutments, the values of maximum sliding, maximum opening, opening andsliding intensity and maximum resulting water flow rate along discontinuities are used as failurecriterions. The results demonstrate that the assumption of dry abutment is not proper for evaluatingthe stability condition and may submit the safety factors much larger than the real values.Moreover, the strength characteristics of rock joints are less significant on the stability of abutment.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Critical filter is one of the principal parts in an embankment dam which is preventing the damagainst erosion. There are important technical and economical problems for engineers to select thefilter characteristics which are acceptable from view points of necessity and economical aspects.Since, experimental methods may cover different parameters of the soil-filter system; experimentalmodeling is characterized as the most appropriate method to investigate soil-filter system. NoErosion Filter (NEF) test has a high capability to evaluate the soil-filter system. Most design criteriaand many researches for grading curve of filter only pay attention to the size of D15 of filter andthere are fewer attentions to smaller size and fine content of filter. In this research using two groupsof filters which have same grading curve in larger size of D15 but are different in smaller size, 24NEF tests were performed. Contrary to existing criteria, the obtained results revealed considerableeffects of fine content and the particles which are smaller than D15 and these factors can causeimprovement or weakening filter performance to control soil erosion.]]></dcterms:abstract>
