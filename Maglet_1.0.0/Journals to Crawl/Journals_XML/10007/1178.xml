Today human is engaged with a great crisis as a result of his unbalancing the life, neglecting indigenous and environmental factors, and hegemonic behavior toward nature. This has ended to creation of an approach called sustainable development whose main aims are to meet the essential needs, improvement of life quality, and better management of ecosystems. Obviously it is meaningless to discuss sustainability and sustainable development in the absence of cities and urban life. Cities are counted for as the main reasons for unsustainability the world over, however urban sustainability and global sustainability are the same concepts.  Therefore, knowing key elements to reach this station is necessary, whereas recognition and prioritization of effective key elements in sustainable development is strategic and entails economic, social, and health-related results in the sequence of time. The current study is descriptive-analytic in which attempts have been made to estimate the importance of main indices of sustainable development based on the opinions of elites using a fuzzy hierarchical analysis process technic. Analysis of the data shows that from among main indices, urban health, desirable governmental system, and sustainable environment are respectively of the highest importance.

Also transformations in the governments role in management of societies’ affairs, has given rise to the budget planning and financial management alterations. Increase in “economic efficiency”, “efficiency”, and “effectiveness” of budget, increases responsible persons’ responsiveness versus their more power in decision-making, leading governments to be convinced to implement such an order. Existence of  a master budget law, defining and ratification of aims and activities of different organs if the government by the law-makers considering the rule of law, implementing auditing order based on performance, giving enough power to the legislative assembly, and government’s reciprocity, are all legal bases for to implement administrative budget planning, which are studied in this article while they are not completely met in the country’s provisions because of structural and legal problems.

Identity and neighborhood-based cultural and historical architectural design and construction of the most important topics in the field of Genealogy of analysis in the era of globalization and technological development requires consistent feedback and interaction architecture, style and technology is If, today, the application of scientific knowledge in the design and architecture of the city is one of the tools of modern urban planning. The rapid advancement of technology and its impact on the construction of cities and towns can change the orientation of technological determinism and simple as a habitual behavior has been dominant.

						<title>Factors Affecting the Primacy of Individual Interests to the Collective Interest in the Zanjan City</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=433&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>
One type of social dilemmas is giving priority to the interests of individual or collectivity. If one ask 'why citizens prefer their individual interests to collective interests when they face conflict between them?', we can identify incidence and prevalence of disorders at different phases of the social body as possible influencing factors. Analytically, the collective interests is partitioned into three level (family, neighbors, citizens) based on hierarchy of structural inclusion and each of them is partitioned into the four phases based on Parsons AGIL framework (Adaptation, Goal Attainment, Integration, and Latency). Relying on extensive theoretical discussions, the factors affecting the priority of individual interests over collective interests were diagnosed according to the collective interests at all levels and phases of the study. 400 Zanjan citizens who were selected with disproportionate sampling method answered to structured questionnaire items about the quantity of the mentioned factors. Results showed that 48 percent of variations in the primacy of the individual interests over private interests are predicted by four identified factors (normative disorders, relational disorders, lack of self-regulation, and the lack of identification). At first, the &quot;normative disorder&quot; and then &quot;relational disorders&quot; are effective factors in increasing the priority of individual interests over collective interests, especially in the &quot;urban&quot; are.

The use of green roofs in architecture and town planning is an important consideration. The use of green roofs and facades covered in most European countries and America States has grown substantially.
