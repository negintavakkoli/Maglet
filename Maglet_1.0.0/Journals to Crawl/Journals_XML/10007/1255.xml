	<abstract language="eng">The present study intended to determine the priority areas for nature-based tourism in Isfahan province, Iran. Considering the components in question, this study was applied-developmental in nature and its methodology was descriptive-survey based on a systematic analysis of the potentials utilization, potential assessment and identification of priority areas and their combination. To carry out the assessment, the natural tourism attractions were ranked in terms of three variables, namely number of attractions, level of performance (national, local and international) and level of access (pedestrian vs. car). As the findings of the study indicated, the Southern and Western regions of Isfahan Province were of the greatest potential for natural tourism. For ranking purpose, Isfahan Province was divided into 5 categories and it was found that Semirom, Chadegan, Fereydunshahr and Fereydan counties scored the highest hence, these counties can be considered as the priority areas for nature-based tourism development. The study on the potential assessment of Isfahan Province in terms of nature-based tourism development revealed that based on the assigned scores, approximately up to %15.18 and %11.78 of the natural tourism attractions existing in this province are located in the Semirom and Fereydunshahr counties, respectively. Accordingly, it can be claimed that these two counties are of paramount significance as the two axial nature-based tourism priority areas in Isfahan Province. As a result, nature-based tourism can be considered as one of the most important development areas for these two counties.

	<abstract language="eng">In today's cities, especially metropolises, the issue of identity and its transformation has become one of the most important issues among urban authorities and designers. Mean while, Mashhad as the second religious metropolises in the world has an identity- causing and effective role among Islamic cities of Iran In recent decades, the amount of urban construction, especially in central part of the city, has significantly increased. This trend has involved identity developments, too. Shohada square as a case study is one of the most crowded squares and the connecting point of six major wags linking Mashhad, railway stretch, Kooh Sangi neighborhood, Khaje Rabei, the Holy Shrine, Ferdowsi square, and Shahid Kalantari highway, which is among the main centers affecting the identity of city – center fabric and creating a sense of place. In this regard, we study the interaction between men and place via the environment's psychological leverage so that in addition to achieve a sense of more satisfaction of the residential place, feelings of attachment to the place, security, identity, and originality is reinforced. However, is seems that what is nowadays defined as an Iranian – Islamic model for urban environments is not an appropriate response for the Islamic community and richness of Iranian architecture. Thus, the value of introducing and offering some suggestions in lined with this requirement and analyzing the bases for the formation and organization of Shohada square as an environment with a historical – religious background is not less than investigating the divine affairs. Findings suggest that there is an increasing trend toward diversity in buildings, especially urban squares we are considering culture as a dynamic issue, so that we could provide an appropriate bed for achieving an original identity, an environment to live, and establishing more spatial attachment for people. </abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Today a huge amount of children’s death rate is caused by accidents which remind us the necessity of scientific evaluation and scaling to make a basis for practical actions in this field both properly and efficiently. In National Documents and International conventions, children’s rights especially Millennium Development Goals declining the children’s death rate has been given a special attention. On the other hand, although the recognition of the reasons of death rate prevalence among children has not been recognized appropriately and comprehensively, what we can infer from the existing statistics is that one important reason which endangers the children’s healthfulness is the accidents. In fact without comprehensive and official statistics from children’s injuries, the rate of epidemical accidents and also without having enough information about the accidents which don’t lead to death or the conceptual difficulties about defining an accident and consensus about it, in academic discourse we cannot consider any  suitable image from the question and its solution, as well. Therefore for reaching exact statistics and also analyzing statistical data, in this article children’s death rates for children aged 18 and under in Tehran in the first step “Cross-sectional method” and “Meta-analytic methods” and also in the second step “The Survey method” have been employed.  In the first step all the previous studies relating to this field of study has been both conceptually and operationally analyzed and the results have been presented in this study. In the second step, through making a conceptual model, the operational variables have been defined and after analyzing the statistics in SPSS, the children’s death status in the 10-year period between 2003-2013 has been analyzed. At the end there are some solutions noted to reduce the death rate arising from accidents between children.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Air pollution is a consequence of human activities, especially in the period after industrial revolution, which has many (direct and indirect) effects on the human and the environment around him. Among different kinds of pollutions, those related to industries and mines are much more dangerous. Therefore, it is necessary to identify these pollutions and specify them so as to reduce the harmful effects of them. In this regard, Isfahan Province is considered one of the industrial and mineral pivots of the country therefore, it is necessary to recognize and define the industrial-mineral pollution in this area. This research examines the industrial and mineral pollution data of the cities located in Isfahan province within a several-year period of time. At first, the data was analyzed by SPSS and then entered into the software Arc GIS, and then the areas were specified. The data of the wind’s direction and speed was also used to determine the relationship between industrial-mineral pollution and the wind. The results showed that as we go from the west and north toward the center of province, the intensity of pollution is increased. The highest amount of industrial pollution belonged to the cities of Isfahan, Borkhar, Kashan, Aran and Bidgol. And regarding mineral pollution, the highest amountsbelonged to Isfahan, falavarjan and Naiin In terms of point, the cities of Khur and Chadegan had the least amount of pollution. The wind's direction in Isfahan province is from the West and in the months of June, July, and August it is from Northwest.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">
One of the risks distinguishes urban projects from other projects is to purchase of property obstacles. The matter is of more significance in large projects. Issues with regard to possessing property obstacles, lack of accurate layout drawings for underground facilities and following probable changes in designs make it vital to have specific studies on risk management of such projects. So this paper investigates the implementation of risk management plan in large urban projects through a case study, namely Imam Ali highway. To do this, first some generic information is discussed in each section and then it is tried to show how incorporate it in the project studied. According to qualitative analysis done, the issues of obstacles, weak feasibility studies, and inadequacies of resources (scaffolding &amp; forming material) were the main risk factors of the project. In another effort, using Monte Carlo Simulation, the quantitative analysis was done on some outputs of qualitative analysis, and numerical probabilities to achieve scheduled finishing date of the project were obtained.

In architecture design works even the ones which have been designed so close to nature, still there are some missing parts in one of their forms, function, or structure. Therefore, the best solution for the architects and designers to increase the optimization in their design works is looking at the nature in every aspect deeper and try to apply them as much as they can in their conceptual design of their project which is the heart of the design process, the point at which the actual form, character, and design details of the project are the best established and finalized. Although, there are a wider areas of inspiration from nature studies in architecture like organic architecture, constructive architecture, deconstructive architecture, and etc. but this study is not going through the philosophy of inspiration from nature and it focusing on the more engineering ones like bionic architecture, Bio mimicry and levels of inspiration.

	<abstract language="eng">
Demand of energy is more sensible now because of population growth and economic growth of countries. In order to increase of energy consumption around the world and environment pollution, attention to the renewable energy such as solar energy is inevitable. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) electric power systems not only produce electricity, they are also part of the building. For example, a BIPV skylight is an integral component of the building envelope as well as a solar electric energy system that generates electricity for the building. These solar systems are thus multifunctional construction materials. The standard element of a BIPV system is the PV module. Individual solar cells are interconnected and encapsulated on various materials to form a module. Modules are strung together in an electrical series with cables and wires to form a PV array. Direct or diffuse light (usually sunlight) shining on the solar cells induces the photovoltaic effect, generating unregulated DC electric power. This DC power can be used, stored in a battery system, or fed into an inverter that transforms and synchronizes the power into AC electricity. The electricity can be used in the building or exported to a utility company through a grid interconnection. The primary intent of this article is to provide architects and designers with useful information on BIPV systems in the enclosed design briefs. Each brief provides specific technical data about the BIPV system used, including the system’s size, weight, and efficiency as well as number of inverters required for it. This is followed by photographs and drawings of the systems along with general system descriptions, special design considerations, and mounting attachment details. The primary intent of this sourcebook is to provide architects and designers with useful information on BIPV systems in the enclosed design briefs. Each brief provides specific technical data about the BIPV system used, including the system’s size, weight, and efficiency as well as number of inverters required for it. This is followed by photographs and drawings of the systems along with general system descriptions, special design considerations, and mounting attachment details. The finding of research shows development strategy is to enhance systems technologies, to work on the architecture of building integrated PV, and to assess and remove non-technical barriers that impede the widespread application of PV in the built environment.

Cities are centers of technology-based transformations and play pivotal role in economic procedures. Moreover, cities are the social, cultural pivots and center for political challenges either in peace or violence and war. Cities possess a distinguishing share in societies’ economic growth and development. Future of the development of the developing countries is concentrated in cities. Therefore, the article aims at empowerment of urban development and also recognition of relations and modeling of the mentioned elements. Empowerment of urban development is recognized through investigation of the literature of the subject and elites’ opinions. Thereafter, using Interpretive Structural Modeling, the relationship between these empowerments is recognized, based on which a structural model of empowerments effective in urban development is constructed. The results show that economic and cultural, technological, environmental, and population factors are among the most important empowerments in the context of urban development. Based on the results, managers are recommended t concentrate more on these radical factors in their urban development-based activities.

	<abstract language="eng">
In response to the facts that some Asian developing countries were experiencing the fastest rate of industrialisation and urbanisation, several international initiatives called for a better and ‘sustainable’ urban management. Development of management tools including strategic environmental assessment (SEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), cost benefit analysis (CBA), and environmental management system (EMS) had widened a scope of traditional management remarkably. For instance, urban water management that used to deal only with an aspect of ‘urban water’ is nowadays required to consider urban water issues in a larger perspective, namely whole river and catchment’s ecosystem. The management of the latter is called river basin management. Yet still, it is also realised that various managements (e.g. air, poverty, water, socio-economic etc.) were actively inter-linked and influenced each other on the same platform of ‘urban’ and could not be dealt in isolation. As a challenge to respond to these complex urban problems, an ecosystem approach was considered to be a powerful tool to achieve a holistic management. By taking widely known ecosystem approach frameworks into consideration, this paper attempted to discuss on applicability of ecosystem approach to urban air pollution management. The review provided current knowledge on urban air pollution problems and pros and cons of urban and peri-urban agriculture as an example. In discussion, millennium ecosystem framework and human ecosystem frameworks were explored in terms of urban air pollution management. This inspired a process approach and its usefulness was analysed in the light of translating the philosophy of ecosystem approach into practise. In this particular case, ambient urban air pollution and promotion of urban and peri-urban agriculture was discussed as an example. The findings showed that although the process approach could supplement those frameworks in practise to some extent, it had a difficulty in addressing the social system that played a major role in urban ecosystem. It was indicated that the social system was considered to associate closely with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the target area. And the approach must figure out a way to incorporate them effectively towards successful urban ecosystem approach. The suggestion was made on another approach that could facilitate to bring the philosophy of ecosystem approach into actual urban management.

	<abstract language="eng">
The relation between nature and human considers different periods. At first it was bio-utilization which degrades the value of nature as a source of energy and material. After revolution in science development and attention to the damages which they made to environment, they tried to change their look to this issue and expand the mean of relation between human and nature. Birth of such word like ignition emphasize on the new point of view at nature. Bionic is the science that is formed from the combination of various natural and engineering science concepts. It is the study of complex vital systems of live organisms and natural forms and maybe a good solution for solving technical and structural issues of engineers. Nowadays when it is talked about technology, different kinds of cars and big buildings are stroked in human mind It is clear that if the technology result which is the answer of fundamental human needs is considered, it almost will be clear the reason of some circumstances, that each industrial or structural phenomena has been inspired from which natural alive pattern, so it has to be a relation with logical and scientific principles between mechanical system and alive constant system. The first zone contains human and nature informant principles and introduces their relation periods. In the second zone it is surveyed nature rule in human life, in third zone the nature is presented as a teacher and a source of human sprite, and the last zone expresses the relation between architecture and nature and the architecture usage way from nature with some real examples and finally the way for reaching a favorite architecture and the advantages of patterning natural forms and the cause of knowing nature order more and more considered at the conclusion.

	<abstract language="eng">
Following the global trend of economic and social change, urbanization has been increasing. The trend that has dominated in recent decades in developing countries is the outshining of growth over development which has challenged the maintaining and improving the city residents’ quality of life. One of the most recent topics in the theory of urbanism in response to the decline of urban life  has been addressing the concept of &quot;livable city&quot; that includes all aspects of environmental, social, cultural, historical, infrastructure, governance and participation and applies the strategies such as new urbanization, urban smart growth and increasing development by pressing and human scale of city construction and user intermixture to create diverse options of transportation habitat, attractive and walkable neighborhood which improve the life quality and lead us to have a better environment and more sustainable urban development. The Present study examines the livable ranking of Tehran city and since a livable city is composed of strong neighborhoods, we examined livability of Darake by considering the global indicators and its compliance with local standards. The research method is descriptive-analytic and the results indicated that: auto-oriented transportation, non-variety in settlement and shortage of public spaces are three factors of reducing livability of Darake Neighborhood in Tehran and finally, some suggestions are given in order to increase its livability.

	<abstract language="eng">
This essay is considered an attempt to present how semiotic studies can be used as a perceptional aspect in reading architecture and urbanism. Appearance of each art is similar to creation of a “text” which transfers a set of customs, values and thought together with itself. Production of each “text” is based on its context, culture and intellectual bed of its origin society. Each text is an independent message from its sender, receiver and covers a set of signs. These signs are coded by author and audience (reader) decodes it on the basis of conventions and with the help of media relation, mental impressions, and personal points of view. Semiotics is the philosophical and scientific study of semiotic: the relation of signification with sign, mind and object or more generally, the creation of meaning. Semiotic is divided in two main thought schools of structuralism and post-structuralism. Structuralism semioticians (such as “Saussure”) mostly specialized in linguistic domain, typically consider a direct relationship between the signifier and signified. By contrast, post-structuralism semioticians (such as “Peirce”, “Umberto Eco”) consider the relationship as an indirect one and seek to discover the implicit “signified” hidden in social, logical and aesthetic issues. The architecture and urban spaces has been consisted of different layers of meaning like a text. The analysis of urbanism, architecture and their spatial configuration is always seen between cognition, culture, knowledge, literature and society. These layers would make different meaning and senses for projects to be appeared in the deepest layer of a scheme. This study compares architecture and urbanism reading (like as text) based on the abovementioned perspectives after considering the theories of semioticians.

	<abstract language="eng">Segregation has been widely discussed by social scientists and especially by urban geographers and planners over the past decades. However, regardless of their focus, most of these studies view segregation as an obvious case of spatial injustice. I argue that this implicit relationship between segregation, (in) justice, and space needs to be reexamined. This paper approaches this task by reviewing an interdisciplinary body of literature (including geography, sociology, history, political sciences, and philosophy) that deals with segregation without (explicitly) tackling the issue of justice. It will then question the dominant contemporary discourse that holds that the Just City should be a diverse city at the neighborhood scale.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Here in this article, there is an attempt to pay attention to the importance of people characters (traditional and civil) in the improvement of urban management due to the sustainable urban development. The deduction of this article in that people characters can play an important role in the process of developing and improving the operation of urban management by paving the way far participation of citizens in the urban affairs. These characters are of the basic factor of establishing and supporting the local society, social correlation and social capital.  In this article by the means of secondary analysis, we have settled to considering the present statistic data of the state of people- characterized organizations. Local society in our community in the form of councils, local district councils, religious and civil characters with the support of old  customs of religious resources and also relying to legal resources, have achieved proper abilities  and capacities in relation to mobilize the facilities and participation of people due to the aims of the sustainable development. Considering such abilities, the question is that, how can we use these capacities of present characters of desirable goals of sustainable development, as a sensation of the administrators of the urban management? The goal of present article is to reply this question and to provide same strategies for urban management in order to use the potential and capacities.</abstract>
