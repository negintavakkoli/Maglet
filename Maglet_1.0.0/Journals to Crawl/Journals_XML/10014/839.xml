			<abstract>
			The concept of &#8220;Mentorship behavior of managers&#8221; is significant in organizational behavior and human resource management literature in which diverse opinions are expressed by many human resource scholars throughout the world. This study was performed with a mixed exploratory approach by using the conventional content analysis in qualitative section. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the mentorship behavior characteristics of managers in Isfahan Oil Refinery Company using content analysis&#8217;s systematic design. For this purpose, a semi-structured and in-dept interview with 20 managers of the Company was conducted. The analysis of research data led to a group of initial themes as well as categories through a coding process. Research analysis of semi-structured interviews indicated that mentorship behaviors of the managers under study may be classified under five behaviors including: resonant behavior, perfectionist behavior, self-management behavior, rolling-based behavior and influencing behavior, while each of these behaviors are in turn composed of different concepts. After discovering the category of model presented in the qualitative stage، 80-item questionnaire was designed and regulated to qualitatively validate the extracted model and it was provided for 191 employees under the supervision of senior and middle managers by available sampling method and finally, the validity of the model was qualitatively verified.

			<abstract>
			Research in relation of self-efficacy and the identification of factors affecting it, has been of interest to researchers due to its role and its impact on many behavioral variables in the workplace. Accordingly, this research carried out with the aim of predicting self &#8211; efficacy through perceived organizational support and self &#8211; esteem. Research method was descriptive-correlational and statistical population was all employees of Isfahan province Gas Company. Using convenience sampling, 248 subjects were selected. &#160;They were assessed by perceived organizational support questionnaire (Eisenberger et al., 1986), self - esteem questionnaire (Rosenberg, 1965) and self - efficacy questionnaire (Sheerer &#38; Maddux, 1982). Data were analyzed by use of Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise regression analysis. Results showed that there was significant relationship between Perceived organizational support and self - efficacy (p&#60;0.01), perceived organizational support and self - esteem (p&#60;0.01), self - esteem and self - efficacy (p&#60;0.01). Moreover results of stepwise regression analysis showed that there were multiple relationship between perceived organizational support, self &#8211; efficacy and self &#8211; esteem (p&#60;0.01) and perceived organizational support and self &#8211;esteem could predict 30% of self &#8211; efficacy&#8217; variances. According to these findings, for increasing employees&#8217; self &#8211; efficacy in organizations, we should pay more attention to employees&#8217; self &#8211; esteem and organizational support.

			<abstract>
			The human resources domain has interactions and communications with different functional and operational areas in organizations and can therefore have a significant impact on the performance of organizations and the achievement of organizational goals. Therefore, organizations need effective and efficient managers and employees in order to achieve their goals for comprehensive growth and development. In this research, we intend to investigate the mediating role of organizational maturity on the impact of leadership styles on employees' organizational commitment in Assaluyeh Petrochemical Complex. By studying the related literature in the areas of research, we considered the Avolio and Bass (2004) model (Transformational and Transactional Leadership Styles) in order to determine the leadership style of managers ; and the Allen &#38; Meyer (1990) organizational commitment pattern (emotional commitment, continuous commitment, normative commitment) as a basis for assessing the status of Organizational commitment of staff ; and we applied the human resource capability model (P-CMM) to determine the level of employees' organizational maturity. Data was analyzed using Smart-PLS software. The results showed that there is a significant relationship between leadership style of managers with organizational commitment of employees in Assaluyeh petrochemical complex. Also, organizational maturity has a mediator role in the impact of leadership styles on organizational commitment of employees in Assaluyeh Petrochemical Complex.

			<abstract>
			In recent years, there have been many advances in the Iranian gas company on issues related to safety, health and environment (HSE), but there has not been a proper decision-making structure, and decentralization and reworking have been carried out. The main objective of this study was to investigate the institutionalization of the safety, health and environment culture among the staff of the Tehran Gas Company. The research carried out in this paper is a descriptive-survey research based on the the field research. The statistical population of the research was the staff of the staff of Tehran Gas Company consisting of 775 people. At first, by using the exploratory factor analysis method and through the optimization of the main axes and the rotation of the varimix, dimensions of the HSE culture were identified among the staff of the Tehran Gas Company including eight factors. Then the ranking of HSE culture was computed from the highest to the lowest based on the results of Friedman's analysis: the status of supervisors and managers; the managerial commitment; the staff's ability; the staff's attitude towards the HSE culture; the status of the communication; the status of employee participation; the reporting and priority of safety, health and environment. Finally, by using the T-test, the institutionalization of each dimension of the culture was investigated. The results showed that all of these dimensions were institutionalized, except for the ability of employees in the Tehran Gas Company.

			<abstract>
			The intense of competitiveness in the business environments and its serious changes have made knowledge management a soloution for rescuing the organizational capital. Knowledge management in terms of its fundamental importance is required to be developed. The purpose of this research was to investigate the future of knowledge management and extract the challenges of the National Petrochemical Company in order to achieve the desired future of KM by using field research . In this way, research tools such as interviews and questionnaires as well as library studies have been used. This step has been achieved by measuring the current adaptability of the company and analyzing its gap with the primitive consistent status of &#34;Value-based KM&#34;. At the end, solutions were proposed in two areas: culture and organizational structure. These solutions emphasize the strengthening of organizational social awareness as well as enhancement of human resources capabilities for recording and promoting value-added knowledge (in two industrial and organizational categories).
