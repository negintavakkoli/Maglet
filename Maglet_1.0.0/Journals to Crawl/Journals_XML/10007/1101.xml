 MollÄ�SadrÄ� Avenue in Shiraz has a variety of attractions
and numerous gravitations which lead people to having a quasi-permanent
presence in this important public space. Coming to shopping centers, window
shopping, flÃ¢nerie and the ability to see people and be seen by them, makes
MollÄ�SadrÄ� Avenue a vibrant hub full of crowd and enjoyment. But in the other
hand the lack of well-designed sidewalks and their limited width, the lack of
public places to seat, relax and gather and an obvious shortage of activities
throughout the night and holidays accentuated by traffic jam and mediocre
physical and architectural conditions, decrease the eventuality of public
interactions. This research seeks to reveal the role of effective factors in
improvement of public interactions in MollÄ�SadrÄ� Avenue as a vibrant public
space. As such, after studying and
analyzing the pertinent factors in public interactions an entire field research
process has been accomplished. The result of the research is shown as an urban
design framework categorized by activities, aesthetics and experiential aspects
and environmental issues which demonstrate the direction of the process of
urban design to make MollÄ�SadrÄ� Avenue an interactive urban space. This urban
design framework could be used as a model to the revival of commercial and
leisure streets elsewhere in Iran.

 Today urban sustainability policies more than ever has clarified
the importance of neighboring units and local communities within the concept of
sustainable development. Therefore, urban management has focused on planning in
the scale of micro level. Although, addressing the micro level at the urban
planning doesn't have a long history in the country, but during recent years
Tehran Urban Management with the founding the &quot;Neighborhood Councils&quot;
and then &quot;Neighborhood Houses&quot;, as a place for neighborhood
management action, has been taken an important steps toward achieving it. In
this study, urban well governing, neighborhood-based planning and the
necessities and importance of developing neighborhood management In order to
respect to citizen participation and community capacities are taken into
consideration. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the
effectiveness of neighborhood houses function is in line with the local
management. So In this connection, neighborhood houses of three neighborhood
consist of Evin, Tajrish and Niyavaran that is Located at 1st zone of Tehran
Municipality, have been studied as the our case study and three affecting
factors on neighborhood houses performance consist of
&quot;Information and awareness giving&quot;, &quot;citizen participation in
local management&quot; and &quot;uses of neighborhoods' capacity and
capability&quot; have been evaluated through questionnaire and
interview. The results show that the three neighborhood's houses have
functional differences in these affecting factors. In the factors of
&quot;information- awareness giving&quot; and &quot;participation&quot;,
Neighborhood House of Evin had a better performance in compared with others and
in the factors of &quot;uses of neighborhoods' capacity and capability&quot;,
despite the differences in demographic characteristics and socioeconomic in
neighborhoods, urban management has not considered the
neighborhoods' capacity and capability in the defining of activity sectors in
neighborhood management and neighborhood management still is far
from the community- based planning and well governing principles.

 The entrance space of the cities acts as
one of the urban spaces, a joint linking the natural space outside to the
artificial space inside. The illogical and unscheduled development of the
cities as well as lack of concern for suitable space development paradigms has
brought about weaknesses in the form and content of the entrance spaces of
cities in Iran, causing numerous and various problems and disorders
necessitates taking special and ground-breaking measures. The ravages of the
epidemic until it has been common, This field cannot even meet the minimum
requirements to read as well as an urban area. Expanding the ravages of the
precipitous rate in these areas if that becomes inevitable in the future
components of the inner city Special measures will be necessary to help. Since the entrance space in cities and
urban areas is considered as one of the first spaces in the city which would
deal with the phenomenon given the input patterns in the spatial relationship
between these phenomenons. Studies in urban areas are according to the most
basic approach. Thus, to achieve appropriate solutions in urban planning and
coordinating the input current Due to the nature of the input and understanding
of this phenomenon and the characteristics of One of the most fundamental
issues must be considered in urban design. The entrance spaces of the last cities
to study the evolution of social expression, cultural, political, and economic
and technology over time the patterns of biological communities in the
settlements of the land is affected. Spaces and the entrance gate into the old
town and fort-defined coordinates, Entrance to the corridors with scattered
ugly, worn out and worthless residential buildings And abandoned spaces are disturbing
reports of uncontrolled growth and development of modern cities. Cityâ€™s growth
starting or in other words, definitions of the limits for a city are irrelevant
and meaningless. The purpose of this article Are, Redesigned a neglected part of the city in a new form, and  Expression Coordinated with the needs
of today and Cognition of Urban identity and its Factors and The role of these Factors in Promote identity of the urban entrance space In
terms of visual and quality. In
this research, at first has been explained the
concept of urban space and concept of urban entrance as one
of urban spaces. Then the
concept of identity as an expectations expected of entrance of cities and the concept of urban identity and its Factors are described. Finally,

 The
performance of  landscape ecology and its
subsequent changes are hierarchically associated with three levels: the
construction of patched units of ecological corridors, the construction of corridor
units of ecological networks, and the construction of ecological-humanistic landscape
configuration.Where Tehranâ€™s landscape is concerned, a lot of changes have
happened in the quality of natural resource, and man-made constructions have
increased. An important element of Tehranâ€™s landscape in the north is its
valuable natural resources in 7 river-valleys of Chitgar, Kan, Farahzad,
Darakeh, Maqsoodbaik, Darband, and Darabad that extend from the west to the
east, playing an essential role in promoting ecological interactions.The
increasing developments of cities, growth in constructions, and environmental
pollutions have seriously challenged these important elements of Tehranâ€™s
landscape. On the other hand, the principles of landscape ecology regarding the
development of urban river-valleys highlight the importance of managing the landscapeâ€™s
natural resources, and the need to include them in the hierarchical landscape
planning. In order to get to the core of this subject and realize the levels of
performance appraisals for urban river-valleys, the present study aims to
evaluate the three levels of ecological performance for Darakeh River-Valley in
Tehranâ€™s landscape configuration by using the analytic network process. Any
degradation in the biological and spatial quality of urban river corridors
causes the biological and spatial transcendence of urban landscape to come to a
stop. Therefore, in leading the sustainability program for river corridors,
paying attention to the indicators of construction measurement alone in
configuring applications and ecological patches are not enough, but the
qualitative indicators for the performance of patches and corridors need to be
considered in balancing, stabilizing, and transcending landscape ecological
interactions. In this regard, the â€œSuperDecisionâ€� software is used.

To obtain participatory community based development in recent major areas where face to face interactions are not available for all members of society, participation of ICT services in urban planning and management, offers a higher level of partnership due to increase in the amount of information and the quantity of partners in processes. This article is trying to propose an electronic participaation concept and evaluation of its applications in Tehranâ€™s neighborhood management and planning. In addition, it attempts to introduce a pattern to derive benefit from advantages of novel communication technologies to facilitate public participation. 
In this research, various methods of applying these tools will be discussed and some solutions are suggested to promote the e-participation level of people along with designing an interactive website for Enghelab neighborhood (District 11) in Tehran. This inquiry has a qualitative approach and uses library research, field works, observational studies, interviews and will study existing experiments.
Based on research findings in selected neighborhoods, the interaction level and e-participation facilities have been evaluated inadequate. All under study and neighborhood related weblogs and websites have an informative role rather than two way interaction between neighborhood and residents. Thus, the goals and approaches for Enghelab Website are based on access to a participatory website with discussion forums and other participatory facilities. Along with identifying the real communication constraints among citizens and officials by implementing the suggestions in high levels of e-participation, it is expected that residentsâ€™ acceptance of participatory websites will be increased.

Urban distressed area has been a serious problem in many cities in Iran for decades. One of the fundamental trends in Iranian government has been the implementation of consistent strategies for overcoming problems of urban distressed area. Old historical zone of Shiraz city is among the distressed area with different cultural, social and physical problems. Amongst the improvement and renovation policies for dealing with distressed areas is the concept of the people participation. 
Partnership is part of the social responsibility to overcome the urban problems. â€˜People Participationâ€™ is a very commonly used term in the urban development literature as well as in policy making and implementation by both governments and non-governmental bodies. It can be defined as an interventionist process leading to a sustainable improvement in the standard of living and welfare of the people living in the distressed areas.  
What people say is also what they believe as well as what they need. When investigating about the population structure of Shiraz distressed area, what the residents believe about their living area and their partnership in improvement and renovation is very important.
The current study investigated what factors motivate people to participate in improving and renovating their living areas. For this purpose, answering the following questions was conducted:
1) What ate the residentsâ€™ views concerning their willingness to cooperate with the government for improving and renovating Shiraz distress areas. 
2) What are the factors that motivate residents to participate in improvement and renovation?
3) What are the barriers that interfere with peopleâ€™ participation?
In this study, the technique of the questionnaire is used and the statistical analysis of the questionnaire is carried out using the SPSS program. By using the questionnaire data, the population structure of Shiraz distressed area and their willingness to participate in improving and renovating program were identified. The questionnaire carried out in this study consisted of 21 questions. The questions were presented in either a short answer or multiple-choice format. The questionnaire survey carried out from July 2012 until November 2012. 400 residents of the entire population of old historical zone of Shiraz city were asked to answer the survey questionnaire. 
In order to analysis the questionnaire. The questionnaire was assessed to see what will encourage people to participate in improving and renovating program. This is assessed by asking respondents to judge the partnership. The respondents were asked to rate the agreement of each item. It refers to the degree to which an individual approve the benefit of participation in improving and renovating program. 
There are different motivations affecting the people participation in improving and renovating program. For finding the motivations affecting the people participation, Kendallâ€™s tau correlation coefficient was calculated for bivariate comparisons between partnership and different items. Strong association was found for age and gender of the respondent. Also, the respondents who like to have relation with their neighbors and those have participated for regeneration and revitalization of urban distressed areas have more tendencies in participation. 
The most important reasons for participating in improving and renovating program identified through this study were security progress of districts, the houses firmness and district cleanness. Survey respondents also indicated that encouragement of others, significantly contributed to the participating in improving and renovating program.

Citizenship rights are substantially established on the basis of three principles of civil rights, political rights, and social rights and are considered as the main elements of the human rights. Several factors are involved in non-observance of citizenship rights though the main factor is dissatisfaction of citizens with the current atmosphere dominating on the personal life and generalizing the same to the public and urban space. The present research aims at extraction of definitions of â€œcitizenship rightsâ€� from the viewpoint of the citizens. To achieve this goal, Pearson correlation coefficient method is used in the first section to clarify the correlation between the variable of â€œnon-observance of regulationsâ€� and other defined variables and quality content analysis method is used in the second section to extract the main points in relate to the various aspects of citizenship rights. The research studies indicate that the most effective factor on abnormal behavior of the citizens and non-observance of rules and regulations is dissatisfaction with the mental-psychological conditions dominating on the mental space of citizens the conditions arising from the private space of an individual that will be transferred to the public space and may lead to improper behavior by the citizens and infringe rights of other citizens. On the other hand, the findings in the second section of the research reveal that citizenship right is differently defined among various classes of society and concentrates on the mental needs and concerns of citizens in every class. It seems that inspiring the thoughts of those who define citizenship rights to the public minds and modifying or enactment of new laws on citizenship rights may considerably help the public education and internalization of the citizenship rights and laws.
