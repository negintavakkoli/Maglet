The purpose was to introduce various factors affecting the accuracy of the compressive strength test in accordance with current standards and evaluate the effect of some effective parameters such as equipment, mortar preparation, sample preparation, loading rate and etc. To check the Reproducibility of the compressive strength test a program was developed to assess the possible modes through changes in loading rate matrix, standard sand, sample preparation, and tester. The changes of each parameter were measured within ۲, ۷ and ۲۸-day interval, while other conditions were considered as constant based on the EN۱۹۶-۱ and ISIRI ۳۹۳ standards. According to the test results, the most important factors in creating the difference in results are the type of the sand and loading rate. The changes in the Reproducibility percentage using different sands with softer grains increases the coefficient of variation and reduced performance of the test. Also in some cases, with increasing the loading rate up to ۴۰٪, the compressive strength of ۲۸ days is increased by ۱۳٪.</field></doc></add>
