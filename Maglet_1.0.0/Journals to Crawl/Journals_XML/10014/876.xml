Categories for positive pre-models include &#34;charismatic&#34;, &#34;humanistic&#34;, &#34;committed to securing,&#34; &#34;emotional maturity,&#34; &#34;high decision-making power,&#34; and for negative patterns of titles, &#34;self-protecting&#34;, &#34;deceitful&#34; and &#34;narrow&#34;. After the discovery of the categories of implied leadership theories in the qualitative stage, a quantitative validation of the model was developed and a 28-item questionnaire was designed and distributed among 128 samples under the supervision of units' heads, and the validity of the model was confirmed.</Abstract>
