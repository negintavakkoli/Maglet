	<abstract_fa>&lt;p style=&quot;margin-right: -0.05pt;&quot;&gt;Value stream mapping because of being able to understand process bottlenecks, as one of the most common tools for analyzing, identifying and eliminating various losses in operational and support processes are used. On the other hand, inventory management, precise control entry and exit of goods, accurate and timely information about the inventories status and planning, reduce product maintenance costs, including important issues organizations have a special look to it to consider the whole objectives and strategies, making procedures and policies that have a positive effect on the overall organization&amp;rsquo;s economy. In this paper, the use of value stream mapping as a lean production technique, in a production process to improve inventory control is discussed. This is a tool seeks to reduce losses, especially losses related to inventory by mining a bearing manufacturer companies. In this study, the literature of value stream mapping considered. The current state and future state of the company drawn in order to improve production process and losses in the company's future status. In addition, after drawing the mapping, the results of the simulation software Arena and the final report suggests that the use of this technique has an impact on reduce losses and increase inventory turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
