title = {Assessment of the GAP-SENSOR Use for Measuring Maximum Shear Modulus in Layered sandy and Gravelly Dacite Materials}, 
abstract ={Among dynamic parameters, the maximum shear modulus and damping ratio of the materials has the great importance in the dynamic analyses. In this paper, the high frequency GAP-SENSORs (20 kHz) is used to measure shear wave velocity of the sandy and gravelly Dacite materials in the cyclic triaxial equipment. The test procedure is as follows: firstly, a weak impact on the top cap triaxial specimen is induced. The induced low horizontal and vertical displacements time histories (strain in the range 10-6) are recorded using data logger with rate of 100,000 samples per secent for each channel. Then by traveling time and distance between two GAP-SENSORs, wave velocity is measured. Finally, by calculating the poison ratio via horizontal and vertical strains, the maximum shear modulus of the material is calculated. The results indicate that the value of wave velocity is increased by increasing confining pressure, and their values are dependent on particle size. Also, using the reduced vibration amplitude technique at different levels of specimen, damping ratio value is calculated by temping method. By comparing the results of shear modulus and damping ratio using local measurement of axial strain (with GAP-SENSORs in the cyclic triaxial) at small strain level with the results of the proposed method, cofirmed the high precision of the innovative used method.},

title = {Investigation on the effect of sedimentary basin on engineering properties of soils of Kerman city based on resistance behavior}, 
abstract ={Kerman city and its surrounding towns in terms of morphology, consist of a flat alluvial plain of fine silt and clay materials. These sediments have very gentle slope, and constitute the city's main infrastructure. Natural soils generally are structured by passing times due to the influence of environmental factors. Geological factors in Kerman alluviums have caused fine structure after deposition. This paper studies briefly sedimentary basin Kerman, mineralogical and geotechnical properties of the sediments of these areas.semi-qualitative analysis of samples has shown that the mineral deposits in Kerman are mainly illite, chlorite, smectite and calcite. then In order to evaluate the effect of depositional environments and geological history of the engineering properties of the sediments of the Kerman city, A large number of triaxial tests on reconstituted soil moisture greater than LL and different confining pressures, consolidated drained and consolidated undrained is done . In order to evaluate the applicability of soil behavior in normal conditions and the reconstructed curves and stress - strain sensitive soils and soil structure compared with standard sensitivity and then their resistance have been investigated. The results of triaxial tests can be used to interpret the depositional environments and geological history. Comparing the curves of stress - strain in natural and reconstituted samples indicates that in many cases the behavior of intact and reconstituted soils were similar and cementation and soil structure have not been much development. Also Comparison of electron microscopy images of reconstituted and intact samples, not random arrangement of particular structure and soil compaction within the city limits have confirmed. therefore, soils of Kerman are relatively similar by the influence of depositional environments and geological history. these soils have a lot of structure and cementation and are generally compact and strengthening.},

title = {Development of a new method for estimating strength of rock blocks using non-destructive ultrasonic wave}, 
abstract ={Non-destructive methods such as ultrasonic wave velocity are extensively used for estimating physical and mechanical properties of rock due to the simplicity, economical, fast and harmless nature. Rock constructions have been made worldwide from past to present. Determination of strength of rock constructions such as archeological evidence is not possible using conventional rock strength tests. Developing a cheap, simple, non-destructive, efficient and accurate method to estimate the strength of such constructions can be useful. Rock blocks and constructions have various shapes and sizes. Rock blocks having various shapes and sizes have been prepared from marble, travertine, granite, and limestone and ultrasonic wave velocity at various directions of the blocks dimensions and the uniaxial compressive strength of cylindrical core obtained from the blocks have been measured. The results show that shapes and sizes have no effect on the ultrasonic wave velocity. At the end relationships between uniaxial compressive strength and ultrasonic wave velocity have been determined. The uniaxial compressive strength of blocks and rock constructions can be estimated by the obtained relationships using non-destructive, simple and indeed low cost method of ultrasonic wave velocity.},

abstract ={The in-situ stress is one of the most important parameters in the design of underground structures. Conventional methods such as in-situ stress measurements using hydraulic fracturing method has two main disadvantages are time and cost of this methods. Acoustic emission is one of the indirect in-Situ stress measurement methods which is based on the theory of the Kaiser effect. When a rock is stressed, it release acoustic signals this phenomenon is called acoustic emission. Kaiser Effect is defined as lack of acoustic signals in the lower stress levels than the previous maximum stress level. In other words, as long as rock is not reached to the previous maximum stress level, do not show significant acoustic emission. Several factors affect on Kaiser Effect such as delay time, temperature, rock fabric, porosity, discontinuities, joints and geological structure. In this paper, effect of the delay time on Kaiser Effect has been presented. The time between coring operations and acoustic emission test is called delay time. The limestone rock is selected as main samples of test and after preloading, reloading and acoustic emission test were carried out with different delay times. The results showed that the felicity ratio is less than 1, when delay time is about 20 days and after three months has increased to be more than one.},

title = {Investigating the effect of the statistical distribution function of the GSI on the probabilistic analysis of rock mass geomechanical parameters}, 
abstract ={Hoek and Brown suggested a method to estimate the strength and deformation modulus parameters of rock masses. The method was then widely used in rock engineering designs. In such designs, the mean values of Hoek and Brown parameters are often used which are not proper values due to the variability of rock mass properties within a great range of values. In such cases, probability analysis of rock mass properties is highly important. The geological strength index is one of the most important parameters in Hoek and Brown equations. Determination of this parameter includes greater uncertainties than determining other parameters. In this paper, based on the results of rock mechanical tests carried out on rock samples of Gol-Gohar iron ore mine, and the required field surveys, the sensitivity of rock mass geomechanical properties on the type of the statistical distribution function of the geological strength index in statistical analysis of these parameters using Monte Carlo simulation method was investigated. The results showed that the sensitivity of Hoek and Brown equations to determine different rock mass geomechanical parameters varies as the type of the statistical distribution function of the geological strength index changes. The sensitivity of geomechanical parameters such as internal friction angle, cohesion, total strength and rock mass modulus on the type of the statistical distribution function of the geological strength index is much less than parameters such as uniaxial compressive strength and tension strength of rock mass. The greatest variations based on changes of the type of the statistical distribution function of the geological strength index are less than 5% for the internal friction angle, cohesion and total strength, less than 10% for the modulus, and less than 25% for the uniaxial compressive strength and tension strength.},

title = {The Assessment of Salt Weathering and Freeze-thaw Effect on Strength and Durability of Upper Red Formation Sandstones}, 
abstract ={Strength and durability of sandstones and their influences from natural conditions, are the most important factors which should be considered as engineering materials. In this study, the effect of freeze-thaw and salt crystallization phenomena on strength and durability of upper red formation sandstones collected from southern part of Qazvin province was investigated. Nine specimens of sandstones (specified by A, B, C, CG, S, S1, Tr, Min and Sh) were collected from different part of studied area, then their physical and mechanical characteristics were determined. In order to assessing the effect of freeze-thaw on physical and mechanical characteristics of sandstones, 60 cycles of freeze-thaw test was performed. Also in order to investigate the effect of salt crystallization on strength of studied sandstone, sodium sulphate crystallization test (100% weight solution of Na2SO4) was carried out in 20 cycles. Physical and mechanical characteristics of sandstones such as point load index, Brazilian tensile strength, wave velocity (Vp) and weight loss were computed after different cycles. To evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw and salt crystallization phenomena on durability of sandstones, slake durability test was conducted on specimens subjected to mentioned processes and changes occurred in slake durability index in 15 cycles were investigated. Based on results obtained from current study, it could be concluded that in comparison to freeze-thaw, salt crystallization can considerably reduce the strength and durability of sandstones and deteriorate them. Also it was found that index tests such as point load index, Brazilian tensile strength, wave velocity (Vp) and weight loss can predict the behavior of sandstones in different cycles of freeze-thaw and salt crystallization tests.},

title = {Comparison the Different Methods of Seismic Response Analysis in Liquefiable sites against Near and Far-Field Earthquakes}, 
abstract ={Due to the increasing importance of geomorphologic conditions on the seismic ground response, the effect of liquefiable soils on seismic ground surface response is discussed. At first, the equivalent linear analysis based on total stress model in the frequency domain is carried out and then the nonlinear analyses based on total stress, effective stress model and considering the pore water pressure development in time domain are done in order to evaluate the differences between the several types of ground response analysis methods. DEEPSOIL.Ver5 software is used based on the latest achievements and various techniques in both solution domains. LNG port project in Assaluyeh, situated in south of Iran, is considered as a case study. Due to lack of the real data recorded near-field fault at the project site, the simulated method is used in order to create the artificial earthquake. Also three far-field earthquakes have been selected based on conventional seismic hazard studies for the seismic ground response analysis. Then, in order to better understanding of the obtained responses, the resulted responses spectra are compared with the acceleration design spectra provided in some valid codes. The result of this study indicates that the pulse effect in the horizontal component of acceleration perpendicular to the fault plane direction, affects severely the surface ground response of the near-field earthquake. The obtained results of the nonlinear modeling of the soil with excess pore water pressure build-up in the time-domain are extremely different from those of frequency-domain responses based on the equivalent linear method. In addition, because of the inherent linearity of equivalent linear analysis which can lead to spurious resonances in ground responses, the peak ground acceleration in the time-domain is lower than the frequency-domain.},

title = {Flow analysis of the Rozieh water conveyance tunnel during the construction and operation phase using numerical simulation}, 
abstract ={Because most part of Iran country is located in a dry climate, construction of water conveyance tunnels is inevitable. One of the major challenges in the construction of these tunnels is inflow of water into the tunnel during the construction and operation phase. The Rozieh water conveyance tunnel whose length is 3200 meters is a part of water conveyance project to the Semnan city and it is located 30 k NE of Semnan city. In accordance with the drilled boreholes, the tunnel route has been classified into eight zones from the geotechnical view. Then the permeability coefficients of host rock were calculated using back analysis approach on the basis of numerical simulation results and water inflow quantity during the construction phase. A parametric study was done on the lining and cement injection zone permeability and the thickness of cement injection zone. According to this study, the effect of injection zone thickness variation on the water inflow quantity is negligible. So with the assumption of 3 meters thickness for the injection zone, the permeability coefficient of host rock after injection were evaluated. Dependent on the initial rock permeability, cement injection could reduce the rock permeability 10 to 1000 times. In addition, the water inflow into the tunnel was calculated using hydro-mechanical coupling analysis. According to this analysis, the water inflow calculated by the hydro-mechanical coupling analysis is 50 to 70 percent less than the hydraulic analysis.},

Following collection and analysis of the information related to environmental conditions of the area of study and technical specifications of dam construction, a list of probable risk factors was prepared in the form of a questionnaire, and for verification, the questionnaires were provided to a group of specialists consisting of elites and professors specialized at the disciplines relevant to environment and civil engineering. Number of questionnaires was determined based on Cochran&#8217;s formula. In the first step, the expert group in the research was asked to score in Likert scale format so as to analyze the acquired responses and the risks present in the region. Having analyzed the scores using the findings of PHA method, TOPSIS technique was applied to prioritize the identified risks of Paveroud Dam. The results indicated that erosion had the highest priority among 36 risk factors. After prioritization among the risk factors, risk was also assessed using RAM-D technique in which &#8220;impact on Sorkhabad Protected Zone with 9 scores, &#8220;erosion&#8221; with 6 scores, and &#8220;work at high elevation&#8221; with 3 scores were recognized as three major risks of Paveroud Dam. In order to mitigate the effects of dam risks during construction phase, environmental management planning is crucial, and for this purpose, risk mitigation choices were recommended at the end aimed at coping with the identified risks.},

abstract ={The Sharbyan river is located in the Sharbyan village, Sarab, East Azarbaijan province. This river alluvials are supplied from rock units belonging to Oligo-miocene and Miocene, including conglomerate, sandy lime, limestone, marl and shale. These deposits are used as raw materials of producing hot asphalt in two asphalt plants that have been built in the vicinity of this river, and the produced asphalt is used mainly in the neighbor provinces that have rather cold climate. Combined analysis of the sediments indicate high level of silica, around 60 percent, for which&#160; the prepared asphalt&#160; is prone to stripping phenomenon in the cold seasons. During this process, the moisture penetration in aggregates and asphalt mixtures, causes weakening bitumen-asphalt materials bounding and finally asphalt demolition.&#160; The role of sediments and its impact on the quality of asphalt has not been studied in this area, therefore, the solutions for dealing with this phenomenon is also examined and presented. This study is based on the conventional sedimentology methods, different standards of ASTM, AASHTO and Ministry of Roads and Urban Development guidelines. In this study, the combined effects of hydrated lime (lime filler) and natural filter materials with different proportions was used to deal with the stripping phenomenon, and&#160; the parameters of strength, softness, indirect tensile strength, asphalt quality and durability criteria, have been appraised. The results show that these parameters are improved using additives in various proportions and the produced asphalt quality and durability is better. The results illustrate, when the lime is used in its maximum ratio of 3%, stripping score is 1 and is disappeared by other parameters improvement},

abstract ={This paper presents landslide assessment and landslide hazard zonation of the Polroud Dam area. Polroud Dam is one of the largest dams that are in construction, 29 km south of Roudsar in Gilan Province. Considering to geomorphology and geological conditions of the area, the site is susceptible to landslide hazard. Field survey shows many evidences of the instabilities especially in the slopes overlooking to the dam and the reservoir. The historical record also demonstrates high potential of the region to slope instabilities. A large landslide that occurred in 1996 discern that the frequency of the hazard in the region. Therefore, Identification of the landslide potential hazard is vital before impounding the reservoir. In this study, we investigated landslide hazard in the site and we have prepared landslide hazard zonation map using the main parameters. These parameters include; slope percent, slope aspect, lithology, fault, roads, drainage catchment, elevation, vegetation and precipitation amount. Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) has been used to prepare and to cross the maps. The results show that about 26 percent of the slopes are situated in highly hazard zones. It was determined also that lithology and slope aspects play main role in occurring of the landslides in the study area. &#160;},

abstract ={Soil nailing is a prevalent method for temporary or permanent stabilization of excavations which, if it is used for permanent purposes, the seismic study of these structures is important. There are a few physical models, with limited information available, for the study of behavior of soil nailed walls under earthquake loading. Numerical methods may be used for the study of effects of various parameters on the performance of soil nailed walls, and this technique has been used in the current paper. In this research, the effects of various parameters such as the spacing, configuration, and lengths of nails, and the height of wall on seismic displacement of soil nailed walls under the various earthquake excitations were studied. To investigate the effects of the configuration and the lengths of nails on the performance of these structures, two configurations of uniform and variable lengths of nails have been used. To study the effects of the spacing between nails and the height of the wall the spacings of 2 and 1.5 meters and the heights of 14, 20, and 26 meters have been considered. The seismic analysis has been carried out using the finite element software Plaxis 2D. To analyze the lengths' of nails, it was assumed that the safety factors of stability of different models are constant, and the limit equilibrium software GeoSlope was used. After specification of the lengths of nails based on constant safety factor of stability, the deformations of the models under several earthquakes records were analyzed, and recommendations were made on minimizing the deformations of soil nailed walls under seismic loading.},

abstract ={Durability is a significant parameter in engineering geology and it shows the extent of the degradability of rocks as the result of mechanical and chemical breakdowns. This phenomenon is closely linked to the composition, porosity and texture of rocks. To understand the relationship between the chemical composition of rocks and their durability the mineralogical properties of the rocks along with durability tests under both acidic and alkaline pH environments were determined. Five samples of limestone and three samples of marl were analyzed. The results revealed that rocks containing high levels of CaCo3 were affected in the acidic conditions while rocks containing high levels of SiO2 were not affected by variance in the pH of the environment. These second groups of rocks were more dependent on the texture of their constituent minerals.},

title = {Nonlinear Lining Design Considering Soil-Lining Interaction, Case Study: Gilavand Tunnel}, 
abstract ={There are various methods for the analysis of the interactional behavior of the surrounding land, using the lining structure which is the most common method of deigning lining structure tools for the static loads by using the hyper static methods. In recent years, there has been a question that depicts whether this method provides the best results in designing the tunnel structure or not.Due to the nonlinear behavior of the earth surrounding the lining structure, utilizing the lining method could lead to conservative results in the design. If it is possible to somehow find the forces caused by the real behavior of the land surrounding the lining structure influencing the structure and conduct the design based on them, more optimal results would be obtained. This study is based on the actual behavior of the land surrounding the lining structure and the displacement of the structure caused by forces with linear behavior in the static design according to the non-linear behavior of the land around the tunnel structure. The&#160;behavior is modeled using the non-linear programs and the forces&#160;affecting the lining of the structure will be inference. Also there is a case study based on this method in which the soil interaction with the tunnel analysis and designing the lining structure was first performed and eventually the obtained results were compared with the hyper static method. In this paper, analysis of maintenance system with lower thicknesses considering land-shield, indicated that applying the reinforced concrete with 40cm thickness has the potential to tolerate the applied load but lining with 45cm thickness is capable of tolerating the loads of design and it can be concluded that applying the simulation method combined with the soil and structure besides considering the nonlinear behavior of the soil leads to more economical results in a project.&#160;},

abstract ={This research focuses on the identification and description of various features of pseudokarst in different parts of Alvand granitic batholith, Hamedan, west of Iran. In the literature, karst features have been presented as specific types of terrain or landscapes with particular characteristics suites of well-known surface and subsurface dissolutional forms. Whereas, pseudokarst refers to non-dissolutional surface or subsurface features and landforms created in different areas such as slopes, coastal lines crushed stone areas, lava tubes and permafrost regions. In this research, a comprehensive field investigation program has been carried out. During the field investigations, the most important features of pseudokarst in Alvand granitic batholith have been recognized and classified. Results show a wide range of pseudokarst features in the Alvand granitic rock masses. These landforms are created by erosion, weathering processes and some&#160;holes caused by rock block movements along the rock slopes. Some of the most important forms and features of the pseudokarst in the studied area are consist of tafoni, genama, pseudokarren, talus caves, caves associated with the residual blocks and erosional forms along joints and fractures within the granitic rock masses},

The influence of various test parameters such as fiber content (0.0%, 0.5% and 1.0% by weight), clay content (0%, 10% and 20% by weight), relative density (50% and 90%) and confining pressure (100 kPa, 200 kPa and 300 kPa) were investigated. It has been observed that addition of clay particles to the sands decreased the shear strength of samples. Also, increase in clay content reduced dilation and increased compressibility of the mixed soil. Addition of the fiber to both sands and clayey sands samples improved the shear strength and increased ductility and axial strain at failure point.&#160;},

abstract ={Combination of Adoptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and subtractive clustering (SC) has been used for estimation of deformation modulus (Em) and rock mass strength (UCSm) considering depth of measurement. To do this, learning of the ANFIS based subtractive clustering (ANFISBSC) was performed firstly on 125 measurements of 9 variables such as rock mass strength (UCSm), deformation modulus (Em), depth, spacing, persistence, aperture, intact rock strength (UCSi), geomechanical rating (RMR) and elastic modulus (Ei). Then, at second phase, testing the trained ANFISBSC structure has been perfomed on 40 data measurements. Therefore, predictive rock mass models have been developed for 2-6 variables&#160;where model complexity influences the estimation accuracy. Results of multivariate simulation of rock mass for estimating UCSm and Em have shown that accuracy of the ANFISBSC method increases coincident with development of model from 2 variables to 6 variables. According to the results, 3-variable model of ANFISBSC method has general estimation of both UCSm and Em corresponding with 20% to 30% error while the results of multivariate analysis are successfully improved by 6-variable model with error of less than 3%. Also, dip of the fitted line on data point of measured and estimated UCSm and Em for 6-variable model approaches about 1 respect to 0.94 for 3- variable model. Therefore, it can be concluded that 6-variable model of ANFISBSC gives reasonable prediction of UCSm and Em.},

title = {Performance Analysis of Nail Walls in Jointed Rocks Based on Excavation-Induced Damage}, 
abstract ={Evaluation of the excavation-induced ground movements is an important design aspect of supporting system in urban areas. This evaluation process is more critical to the old buildings or sensitive structures which exist in the excavation-affected zone. Frame distortion and crack generation are predictor, of building damage resulted from excavation-induced ground movements, which pose challenges to projects involving deep excavations. Geological and geotechnical conditions of excavation area have significant effects on excavation-induced ground movements and the related damages. In some cases, excavation area may be located in the jointed or weathered rocks. Under such conditions, the geological properties of supported ground become more noticeable due to the discontinuities and anisotropic effects. This paper is aimed to study the performance of excavation walls supported by nails in jointed rocks medium. The performance of nailed wall is investigated based on evaluating the excavation-induced ground movements and damage levels of structures in the excavation-affected zone. For this purpose, a set of calibrated 2D finite element models are developed by taking into account the nail-rock-structure interactions, the anisotropic properties of jointed rock, and the staged construction process using ABAQUS software. The results highlight the effects of different parameters such as joint inclinations, anisotropy of rocks and nail inclinations on deformation parameters of excavation wall supported by nails, and induced damage in the structures adjacent to the excavation area. The results also show the relationship between excavation-induced deformation and the level of damage in the adjacent structure.},

title = {Effect of Pile Foundation on Natural Frequency of Soil Layer}, 
abstract ={Free vibration of soil often occurs during earthquakes. Since the vibration caused by earthquake does not have (steady state harmonic vibration) continuity, the alluvium vibrates with its natural frequency between two natural seismic waves. This study evaluates the effect of piles on the period of free vibration of a soil layer using numerical method. In the first stage, using analytical equations for calculation of vibration period of a soil layer and a column with continuous mass, the results were analyzed by the software. In the second step, piles with the same dimensions and distance were added step by step, and the vibration period for the soil layer with piles was calculated. The friction or floating effects of the piles on alluvial soil vibration period was also examined. The results show that as the number of piles increases, the differences between the results of one dimensional analysis of alluvium soil and the results of the software become different, and this creates the need for specific arrangements for seismic analysis of this kind of alluvium (with inserted piles). The results also suggest that end-bearing piles have a greater effect on alluvial soil vibration period, and with increased amount of the floating of these piles, these effects decline. &#160;},

The slope stability analysis is of special importance because of landslides or slope failures can cause major damages life and financial. In studies to determine the factors and parameters affecting the slope is unstable. According to studies, one of the most important factor affecting landslides in this area is the force exerted by the acceleration of the earthquake. With this approach, the maximum possible acceleration of earthquakes in a 50-year period is estimated at the site. On the other hand, based on studies of the geological is determined profile of the slope geometry, physical and resistance parameters to the landslide susceptible.

abstract ={Ground settlement due to tunneling and the effects of the engineering geological factors on its dimensions and extensions, is a very important problem in shallow tunnel excavation projects in urban areas. Empirical method is one of the usual methods to study this subject. The empirical and dimension-less parameters of VL and k are the most important parameters in relation to this method that are estimated according to engineering geological factors. In this research, the values of these parameters were initially estimated based on preceding studies and the ground settlement was predicted using these estimated values of VL and k. In next stage, the results of predictions were compared with the real (measured) settlements happened due to Abuzar tunnel excavation. As the real settlements are less than the predicted ones, it was concluded that the real VL must be lower than the predicted values or the real k must be higher than the predicted values. With regard to the high dependency of these parameters to the soil cohesion, it seems natural cementation of Tehran alluvia has acted as a factor to increase the soil cohesion and has caused to decrease ground settlement due to excavation of Abuzar tunnel. For validation of this hypothesis, preceding findings about alluvia cementation were reviewed and the results of in-situ and laboratory shear and triaxial tests were compared with together. Then it is concluded that the higher cohesions of in-situ shear tests are occurred due to natural cementation of materials existing in Abuzar tunnel route},

abstract ={Soil classification is one of the major parts of geotechnical studies. So assessment of existing methods for soil classification in different areas is important. For soil classification is used in situ and laboratory test results. Sampling and identification tests are laboratory methods for soil classification. CPTu test is in situ method for soil identification and classification, due to accuracy and speed, this test is used widely in geotechnical study today. Many researchers are proposed some charts for soil classifications based on the parameters measured in CPTu test. In this paper for evaluation the performance of these methods, 58 CPTu test results have been used. These tests are related to four areas in southern Iran. The soils are classified by CPTu methods and then they are compared with 372 laboratory soil classification. Research results show the chart proposed by Robertson (1990) which based on Qt, Ft and Bq variables has the best adaptation with the laboratory soil classification in these studied areas. Then according to data obtained from research, proposed a modified charts based on Rf, qt-u0/&#963;΄ v , that show 90% adaptation with laboratory soil classification.},

abstract ={The Bakhtiari dam has located on Bakhtiari River in province of Lorestan. In order to access the crest of the dam, the excavation of a spiral tunnel is being studied. There are other access tunnels which are branched from this tunnel in different levels and are connected to grout galleries. According to the fact that this tunnel will also be used during the operation of the dam,The correct determination of mechanical parameters of rock masses for tunnel design and stability Analysis is very important. In order to analyse the stability of the underground rock structures, the mechanical and engineering parameters of the rock mass must be known. Accurate rock mass properties can only be obtained from large in situ tests. Such tests are seldom carried out as they are very expensive and time consuming. Sensitivity analysis of parameters can be applied for the optimisation of testing schemes. Sensitivity analysis helps to avoid mistakes due to subjective conjecture. In this article, after the introduction of regional geology and determination critical section on the tunnel path, the mechanical parameters of the rock mass surrounding the tunnel are modelled and analyzed by using FLAC3D software (numerical finite difference method). Parameters conducted in the analysis include the elasticity modulus (E), cohesion of the rock mass (C), friction angle (ϕ), coefficient of lateral stress (K) and tensile strength (&#38;sigmat). Ultimately, according to the result of numerical modelling and parametric analysis, parameters affecting the stability are prioritized. The result of analysis showed that in this project, tensile strength of the rock mass does not affect the stability of the tunnel, and Also, in order of priority, E, ϕ, C, k parameters are important in design. The amount of ﬁeld tests for rock parameters can be rationalised according to their sensitivity factors.},

abstract ={The Schmidt hammer provides a quick and inexpensive measure of surface hardness that is widely used for estimating the mechanical properties of rock material such as uniaxial compressive strength and Young&#8217;s modulus. On the other hand, Schmidt rebound hardness can be used for a variety of specific applications. In the mining industries, it is used to determine the quality of rock, which is common practice when constructing rock structures such as those found in long wall mining, room and pillar mining, open-pit mining, gate roadways, tunnels, dams, etc. However, a number of issues such as specimen dimensions, water content, hammer type, surface roughness, weathering, testing, data reduction and analysis procedures continue to influence the consistency and reliability of the Schmidt hammer test results. This paper presents: a) a critical review of these basic issues and b) avaluate the effect of temperature, moisture and uniaxial compressive stress on Schmidt hammer hardness. It was found that water content has a significant effect on the Schmidt rebound hardness (SRH) of rocks. So that increase of water content substantially reduced the SRH of samples. Temperature also had a considerable influence on the SRH. However, relationship between SRH decreases with increasing temperature for tested samples were linear. Also tests results showed that uniaxial loading of samples increases the SRH values.},

abstract ={In this paper, the bearing capacity of strip footings on fiber reinforced granular soil has been studied. The stress characteristics or slip line method has been used for the analysis. In the selected failure criterion, the orientation of the fibers are isotropic and fibers are not ruptured. Seismic effects have been considered in the equilibrium equations as the horizontal and vertical pseudo-static coefficients. The equilibrium equations have been solved using the finite difference method. The provided computer code can solve the stress characteristics network and calculate the bearing capacity. The bearing capacity has been presented as the bearing capacity factors due to the unit weight of the soil and surcharge. Several graphs have been prepared for the practical purposes. Also, a closed form solution has been presented for the bearing capacity factor due to the surcharge. By the parametric studies, the effects of the geometry and soil properties have been investigated. Results show that the bearing capacity increases with an increase on the average concentration and aspect ratio of the fibers, the fiber/matrix friction angle and the soil friction angle. Furthermore, the extent of the failure zone is increased with increasing the pseudo-static coefficients and decreasing the surcharge.},

abstract ={Most of masonry buildings are vulnerable against earthquakes and need to be rehabilitated. One of the pragmatic methods for strengthening is to utilize shotcreting the masonry walls. In this paper the effects of the soil type (in view of seismic behavior) on the rehabilitation of the masonry building by shotcrete are investigated. Three types of masonry buildings are simulated by ABAQUS software and analyzed against three earthquake records to find their reporses and seismic demands. Using five types of shotcrete configuration consisted of shotcrete strips in vertical and horizontal directions for rehabilitation are studied to find the appropriate method for damage mitigation. The suitable method for rehabilitation are used to study the effects of soil type on the rehabilitated buildings. Three records of the Tabas (1979) earthquake which were recorded on different types of soils (Type I, II and III based on the Iranian seismic design regulations) are considered to analyze the sample masonry building. The results show that the shotcrete method is more effective for buildings which are relying on the softer soils and in stiff soils it is recommended to combine the shotcrete method with other rehabilitation methods which are able to strengthen the building without increasing the stiffness of the building, like utilizing post tensioning cables.},

To achieve this objective, it is employs medium to high rise steel bundled-tube rigid frames. The examined structures are designed according to the Iranian seismic code 2800 (4th edition). To study the seismic response, groups of near field earthquake records with their associated properties are selected to perform non-linear time history analyses. The most important characteristic of the chosen near-field earthquake records is the presence of powerful long-term velocity pulses which distinguishes them from far-field earthquake records. The first part of the mentioned ensemble includes two recorded strong ground motions in Iran i.e. Tabas 1978 and Bam 2003, respectively and two powerful records of the Northridge 1994 earthquake. The second part contains one far-field record of the Northridge 1994 earthquake. The selected records are scaled based on the Iranian seismic code 2800 (3rd and 4th editions). The characteristics of seismic performance of each structural model, including maximum relative displacement of each story, seismic base shear and the formation of plastic hinges in the resistant skeleton have been carefully evaluated. The results indicate that using the 4th edition of the Iranian seismic code 2800 produces noticeably lower values of scale factor and their associated seismic responses in the studied structures as well as the nonlinear demand of the main load bearing members under scaled records with those factors, compared to the corresponding analytical cases based on the 3rd edition of the Iranian seismic code 2800. According to the results of this study, the rate of the drift parameter variations of structures that have been evaluated on the basis of seismic code 4th edition in comparison with the seismic code 2800 are experiencing a relative reduction about 30%.},

title = {An Experimental Investigation of Dynamic Force on the Walls of Buried Tanks using Shaking Table Testing in Comparison to Analytical Method Relations}, 
abstract ={Tanks are structures for storing fluids that are made in different sizes, shapes and genera. Today using of tanks for water, petroleum products storage, and industrial wastes, has been developed significantly. The buried rectangular concrete tanks are used for water supply in most cities in our country. Soil-structure interaction is one of the most important issues in seismic behavior of buried tanks. With respects to code 123 that has suggested Mononobe-Okabe equation for dynamic pressure of earthquake excitation, the purpose of this research is to achieve the dynamic pressure of soil during earthquake. The obtained results have been compared to analytical and other experimental researches. Therefore, a series of small-scale experimental tests were conducted using 1g shaking table testing in the laboratory of physical modeling at University of Tehran. The results illustrate that dynamic force and pressure from Mononobe-Okabe and Wood equation are greater than experimental testing results. However Seed-Whitman equation is closer to experimental results.},

title = {Effect of Mainshock-Aftershock Sequence of Ground Motions on Inelastic Response of RC Frame}, 
abstract ={In seismic prone areas, earthquakes happen more than just main shocks which are happen with sequences of shocks include of different intensity of aftershocks. In technical documents, these kinds of several earthquakes are called mainshock-aftershock ground motions. In this study, seismic behavior of RC frame under mainshock-aftershock with different ratios of maximum acceleration of aftershock to maximum acceleration of mainshock was evaluated. In this paper, nonlinear time-history analysis of frame were performed under mainshock-aftershock sequences and then the residual interstory drift ratio for comparing response of frame under seismic sequences was evaluated. The results show that, residual interstory drift ratio of frame, related to intensity of aftershocks to mainshock and enhance of intensity of aftershock due to increase residual interstory drift ratio of frame. Although, growth of residual interstory drift ratio of top stories more significant than below stories of frame.},

title = {Behavioral Properties of Hardness, Ultimate Capacity and Ductility of a new Semi-Rigid Connection}, 
abstract ={With regard to the increase of computing power in the past decades, finite element methods have been used to obtain the graphs of rotational moment curves which reflect non-linear effect in connections response. Several common semi-rigid connections are modeled and their behavioral properties are briefly reviewed, then the details related to a new semi-fixed connection have been provided. The behavioral properties like hardness, ultimate capacity and ductility are investigated and compared to other simulated connections. To perform non-linear analyses of connection, finite element software ABAQUS is used. In this simulation, it has been tried to have inter-component interactions according to reality as much as possible. Bolted connections are modeled exactly and the interaction among the bolt surface and hole is modeled as a hard friction with friction coefficient 0.3 with the ability of separating after loading. Also, fillet welds are modeled as a prism with triangular section. Where a groove weld is applied, since the strength in this type of welding is like base metal, two connection parts are stuck together. To mesh the element, C3D8R element is used.&#160;The proposed connection n1 has the most rigidity values among semi-rigid connections. Reducing the number of connection bolts has more reducing impact on connection rigidity value, so that with the half thickness of upper and lower sheets, rigidity rate is reduced only 9%, but with the half number of bolts, rigidity rate is reduced about 64%. Also the connection n3 have lowest rigidity rate and its rigidity amount is in the class of bolted connection in seat angle to web angle.},

title = {Parametric Study of the Effect of Structure on Seismic behavior of Slope Topographic by Considering Soil Structure Interaction in Medium Stiffness Soils}, 
abstract ={Previous earthquakes have shown that topographic irregularities have significant impacts on the site seismic response and increasing structural damage by amplifying seismic responses. Studies on seismic behavior of slope topographic have shown that dynamic response of free field and soil-structure system is severely on the influence of topography shape and soil properties. Angle and height of slope, frequency of excitation, nonlinear behavior of soil and depth of bedrock are other parameters that affect on the response of the entire system. Furthermore the studies have shown that presence of structure adjacent to slope is very effective on variation of seismic behavior pattern of this topography but these studies are very limited. In this study the effect of existing structure adjacent to slope to seismic behavior pattern of slope topography have been investigated. The parameters that have studied in this article comprise slope angle and frequency content of excitation. The results show that the presence of structure adjacent to the slope, causes an increase to the response of free field and transmitting maximum response to distance away from structure position.},

title = {Numerical Modeling of Ground Vibrations Induced by Impact Pile Driving Using Finite Element Method}, 
abstract ={Consecutive impacts of pile driver hammer on a precast pile head for pile installation in the ground is called impact pile driving. Nowadays, the widespread use of impact pile driving in pile foundations construction is undeniable; As a result, pile driving is the most common source of construction vibrations among the sources of producing ground vibrations. The ground vibrations during pile driving is the most important factor of limiting the use of this method. Thus, to avoid structural damages, acceptable prediction of ground vibration before any project implementation is necessary. For this purpose, numerical modeling is undoubtedly the most accurate, economical and fastest way; but up to now, correct modeling of pile installation process has been the main problem in numerical modeling of pile driving. This study aims to achieve better match of ground vibrations with field results compared to the previous numerical results in terms of peak particle velocity by modeling impact pile driving operation through ABAQUS finite element software from ground surface to a desired depth without considering previous researchers assumptions and considering the details of practical works.},

title = {On the Dynamic Behavior of Bridges Under Moving Loads}, 
abstract ={Due to increasing speed and mass of trains and vehicles, the errors arising from utilizing moving force method to obtain dynamic response of bridges cannot be neglected. In this paper, dynamic response of bridges under moving loads is studied. The bridge is modeled as simply-supported Euler-Bernoulli beam. Since in modeling moving loads by moving force method, inertial forces are neglected, this method is valid for a limited range of influential parameters (speed and mass). By considering inertial forces between the moving load and supporting structure, moving mass method can be utilized to extract dynamic governing equations. Numerical results reveal that by increasing speed and mass of the moving load, midpoint dynamic deflection of bridge obtained by two distinct methods differ considerably.&#160; For example, for mass ratio of 0.15 and speed ratio of 0.8, 11 percent difference is observed in midpoint dynamic deflection calculated by two aforementioned methods.},
