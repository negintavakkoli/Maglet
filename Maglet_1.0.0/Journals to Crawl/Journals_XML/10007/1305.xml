	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Today, with the development of urbanization and increased abnormal behaviors, particularly urban crimes, prevention of social harms is of great importance. Social Sciences and Urban Development can prevent crime in urban areas by understanding cultural and social traits alongside other actions, in a way that the wrongdoer finds less opportunity for acting a criminal behavior in urban areas&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; The theory of social capital is intrinsically simple and affecting many other components. The core idea of social capital can be found and summed up in the word &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot;. Members of the community can cooperate and work together through making contacts with each other sustaining this relation. And thus they learn things that cannot be easily achieved alone or is hard-won. Humans are linked through a series of interconnected networks and tend to have values in common with other members of the network. And by expanding networks constitute an asset that can be considered as a form of capital. Obviously, the more people get to know each other and the more common outlook is found within them, we'll have a richer social capital. On this basis, this research will examine social capital in two dimensions, cultural (types of the trust) and structural (social participation and emotional and material support of network). And tries to study the relationship between social capital and social problems in the Pardis new city after explaining the concept of social capital; This research was conducted with survey method using a questionnaire technique. The statistical populations of the study are residents of Pardis new town, who have been selected though a random cluster sampling method. The sample size was determined as 400 people using Cochran Formula and finally data analysis was done with SPSS Software. The results show that increasing social capital components (cooperation, solidarity and social relations), social problems in new towns is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
