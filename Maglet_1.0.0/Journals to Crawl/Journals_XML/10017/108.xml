				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study was an investigation into the medical efficiency of pray regarding general health of the cadets of Imam Ali(puh) Military University. The main research question is: "What are the effects of pray on the cadets' general health?" the participants were randomly selected 700 cadets of Imam Ali(puh) Military University attending voluntarily Pray–Based medical treatment sessions. Out of them, first, 40 subjects were randomly selected and then divided into two equal groups, experimental and control ones; both were exposed to a per-test. Then, the experimental group received a 90-minute pray-based medical treatment for eight sessions; however, the control group received no treatment. Later, both groups received a post-test. As a true-experimental research, it employed GHQ 28 general health questionnaire and the collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Both descriptive and inferential statistics indicates that there is a significant deference between the groups (sig=0.001 and t= 29.65) and the null hypothesis is rejected in that pray-based medical treatment affects general health in areas such as: Physical Stress and Insomnia, Social Inefficiency and Embarrassment".]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Organizational culture is a new notion to the field of knowledge management and organizational behavior. Culture has been traditionally used to describe life quality of human society; however, organizational culture and whatever concerned with people's action and behavior in an organization have been rarely investigated.
Knowledge and understanding what builds up organizational culture and the way it is established and sustained assist us to justify organizational behavior in the best way possible. Through understanding organizational culture exercising control and modeling staff behavior, rendering identity to them creating group commitment and stabilizing totality of an organization are made feasible. This study was an attempt to investigate organizational culture in Imam Ali University based on Daniel Denison's model as a common and   agreed –upon approach.
Findings revealed that the university moderate and relatively higher measures in terms of all four aspects of the model including engagement, adaptation, adaptability and mission; however, the adaptation and mission criteria were evaluated as the highest in rank. Nevertheless, the university was evaluated weak in terms of coordination and development.
On the flexibility– stability continuum, stability loads more, but on that of the external –internal one no significant difference was recorded. In other words, these factors enjoyed equal load, though internal tendency loaded a bit more than the external one.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the current challenges in military units is how to sustain and strengthen military sprit of human force in order to carry out the organizational missions. In this process, various factors and parameters including health, good nutrition, good relaxation, sufficient sleep, lofty ideal, self-confidence and belief affect individual spirit. Sprit is of crucial importance in human relation, which can represent over all human relation in an organization. Spirit defined as totality of feelings, emotions and belief system, is sometimes equated with job satisfaction. Psychologists hold that the spirit refers to one’s emotional and intellectual reactions in an environment. The afore-mentioned discussion raises the question whether military labels, sign and flag can play a role in creating military self-confidence and boost their spirit of action. In other words, what is the relationship between military signs, labels and flag and spirit of military personnel? To find the answer to the question, 385 subjects from among the commanders, personnel and cadets of Imam Ali military university were randomly selected. To collect the required data, a questionnaire was distributed and the data was processed using SPSS, finding sustained positive correlation among the variables and significant effects of the independent ones. In other words, quality of apparent structure, extend of the value of position assigned, use of concept and philosophy of the sign, label and flag have positive correlation with the extent of military sprit and self-confidence.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Organizations either change or are demolished. One of the main developments in late 20 century is the advent of ITC, as one of the main parameters of contemporary progresses which has quickly developed and entailed fundamental changes. Nowadays, employment of IT is being spread in any organization even governmental or   non- governmental.
One of the most important issues revolves around Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Expert Systems (ES) in which employment of IT is identified as a great advent. In this trend, military sector is one of the pioneer areas making efforts in designing and developing these systems and undoubtedly, has been one of the most successful ones.
This paper was an attempt to study the significance of AI and ES developments Which having introduced examples of the use of these systems in military sector, offers an expert system designed for fault-finding with light guns (small caliber) employed by the Army of the I.R of Iran using VP Expert.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In contemporary organizations Knowledge is the main competitive advantage. Knowledge is considered as a powerful means developing and changing continuously. So, controlling and managing of knowlede requires special skills which differ from one organization to another according to its nature. Myriad researchers examined the Critical Succsess Factors (CSFs) in Implementation of Knowledge Management System (KMS). In this particular study, we tried to introduce a comprehensive model identifying CSFs in Implementation of KMS for universities regarding those studies.
To fulfill the aforementioned target, the main CSFs for implementing KMS in the universities were primarily identified from existing litratures. Secondly, for each CSF some Indexes were defined. Then Exploratory Factor Analysis was applied to obtain the main dimensions and key factors by testing the indexes in the universities located in Tehran. Finally, these dimensions and key factors were ranked by Fridman Test.
The final explored model can be employed as an effective and efficient guide and blueprint for measuring the feasibility of implementation of Knowledge Management for Iranian universities and educational and research institutions.]]></dcterms:abstract>
