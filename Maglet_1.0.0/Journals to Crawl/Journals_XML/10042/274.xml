	<abstract language="eng">Cities have many tourism attractions and they always absorb many tourists to themselves; therefore, development of urban tourism and its wise management require planning. Considering the importance of tourism in urban economy and job creation, economic pricing of urban tourism services enjoys a special place in urban management. Garden of flowers is one of the most important tourism areas in the city of Isfahan. Thus, its recreational pricing can be effective in predicting needs and tourism development in Isfahan. The purpose of this research is estimating recreational value of Isfahan&#8217;s garden of flowers and determining the rate of visitors&#8217; willingness to pay for it with contingent valuation method. Data were collected by interview questionnaire with 110 people. Logit model was used to measure people&#8217;s WTP and the parameters were estimated based on maximum likelihood method. Dual two-dimensional method has been used to extract bids. According to the estimated coefficients, revenue and age variables had positive and negative effects respectively on WTP, and women&#8217;s WTP is more than men. The average of people&#8217;s WTP is 4752.49 Rials for recreational use of garden of flowers.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">urbanization process has been faced with servicing inequalities, population distribution, and unbalanced urban growth in developing countries. Instability caused by the unbalanced growth has been represented in the form of lack of spatial-social balances with manifestations of urban poverty, informal housing and employment, and environmental pollution. This research studies existing social and spatial inequalities in different areas and districts of Yazd City and their relationship with each other. Research methodology is descriptive-analytical and necessary data have been collected through library method and mostly using the information of Yazd detailed plan in 2009. Ranking Yazd areas and districts regarding social development using 15 indexes and TOPSIS and Taxonomy method showed that district 3, areas 2-2 are in the first rank, and area 1-2 is in the last place. Choosing the average of land price as a criterion for assessing economic inequality among different areas of the city and comparing this index using ANOVA test indicate that there is a difference among different areas of Yazd so that area 2-3 has the highest value and area 1-1 has the least. Correlation test among the rate of social development of areas and land price in them done with Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient indicates significant and positive relationship between these two variables. Thus, we consider increase in land price in line with social development rise in different areas of Yazd city.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Measuring poverty can make the process of poverty evolutions understandable in every society and present an image of these developments during the time. Government can target and adopt appropriate decisions to do necessary measures as a result. In this regard, statistical study of poverty and its analysis at the level of province can be a guide for planners to reduce penury. The poverty line of urban areas in east Azerbaijan was estimated by using dynamic linear expenditure system (DLES) method assuming the formation of habits and using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model during 2001 to 2011. Components of eight commodity groups including food, clothing, housing, appliances and furniture, healthcare, transport and communication, recreation and education, and a group for other issues were used as well as their price index published by statistical center of Iran. The results obtaining from estimations by using STATA and Eviews soft wares indicate that poverty of urban areas in east Azerbaijan has ascending trend with an average growth rate of 23% during the period under review. The percentage of urban households below the poverty line of the Province is 50 percent on average, and poverty gap and severity of poverty indices have been reduced with average values of 42% and 23% respectively at the end of the period. Thus, according to the results for indicators of poverty, it can be said that although poverty eradication policies during the ten-year period of this research have improved the welfare of the poor people partially, the number of people below the poverty line has increased considerably during this period. The process of escalating prices can be one of the main reasons for this increase that can be solved by the government with curbing inflation.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Undoubtedly, the manner of financing for intended projects depends on the features of each project in any level of existing organizations; therefore, defined and applied indexes and standards should be fitted and overlapped with characteristics of each project. In fact, each project is categorized based on its qualities and appropriate financial instruments are determined according to this criterion. Urban projects have been classified and effective factors on the categorization in urban projects have been identified in this article. Tehran Municipality is compared with some large cities, in this respect. In order to study the issue, equality of external financing of urban projects with transport missions, urban services, and other missions have been examined by using ANOVA analysis, according to the separation of municipal projects to different missions. Better financing can be obtained by better identification and emphasis on the qualities of urban projects of Tehran Municipality and its comparison with other selected cities in the world including Seoul, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur, New York, London, and Istanbul. According to the results, the hypothesis of equivalent amount of external financing municipal projects with municipal service mission in Tehran and other intended cities is not rejected.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Implementation of targeted subsidies law has influenced the revenue and costs of these organizations directly or indirectly. In this regard, studying the impacts of mentioned plan on revenue resources and municipalities&#8217; costs of the country is of great importance with systematic approach in municipalities&#8217; budgeting. The impacts of adjustment policies of energy prices on municipalities&#8217; revenue and costs can be evaluated systematically based on input-output models. What complicates the issue is the adjustment of municipalities&#8217; costs issues.

Rise in the price of energy carriers may directly lead to increase in revenue from value added tax act for municipalities through increasing revenues from duties related to fuel and electricity. In order to estimate the impact of the implementation of the first stage of law on the income item, Consumption and price of energy carriers were used in the years before and after of the law. Having information about price and consumption after targeting, this makes it possible to calculate the increase of Rial value of use of different energy carriers in the year and calculate the rate of increase in duties of each fuel for all municipalities and rural municipalities in the country by using obtained figure and applying toll collection rates related to municipalities, specified in VAT act, as well. The impact of adjustment of energy prices on the inflation of different products can be stimulated by using price model based on input-output table. Increase in the costs of municipalities can be calculated according to obtained inflation in goods and services of the total economy. This type of stimulation will be based on systematic approach and all direct and indirect effects are considered in it. Budgeting of municipalities based on mentioned approach will result in balanced budget.</abstract>
