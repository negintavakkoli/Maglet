	<Abstract>Nowadays communications, decision-making, reporting manner and hierarchy are controlled by organizational structure getting an inside into such structure means getting an insight over the whole organization. It serves as a platform for operation of plans and strategies and also determines links among personnel or executive body of the organization. In line with developments in other elements, organizations must keep thinking of developing their organizational structures. As public, non-governmental entities, municipalities pursue the goal of urban welfare and paving the way for establishment of a mechanism that helps cities achieve sustainable development and growth. These entities constantly need a structure that is tailored to their missions, goals, duties and central activities.  Having a review on the concept of ‘structure’ and ‘thematic dimensions’ in former structure of municipalities and having introduced medium-sized municipalities as developmental entities, this paper conducts a comparative study on executive body of municipalities in order to gain a picture of central activities that municipalities are involved. In sum, this research finds that major characteristics of this structure include incorporation of new parts through vertical and horizontal differentiations, change of view to municipalities as organizations with social responsibilities, incorporation of new parts with the intention to remove parallel tasks as well as reduced expending and financial independence of municipalities.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>The house is a microcosm of culture and civilization because the primary elements of society, individuals organized along with the family lines, are born, raised and educated in them. The strength of the institutions of the family and house denotes the strength of a society and the verve of its cultural and civilizational agenda. Similarly, frailties in the institutions of the family and house denote frailties in a society and in its cultural and civilizational agenda. The house dominion is where people rise and fall, that is to say, where people either succeed or fail in managing and conducting the most crucial aspects of their lives. Housing is where the epicenter of the rise and fall of cultures and civilizations lies. Thus, some of the chief causes of the decline of Islamic culture and civilization, if properly examined, could be related, one way or another, to the complex subject of housing and its own decline and its causes. Likewise, some of the main cures and catalysts for the revival of Islamic culture and civilization could be found right in the subject of reviving genuine Islamic housing. Indeed, Islamizing housing today could be a turning point, as well as an engine of growth, insofar as a total recovery and revival of Muslim cultural and civilizational consciousness and involvement at a world stage is concerned. According to Islamic teachings, human being moves towards perfection if conditions conducive to His/her calmness are realized at home. According to this view, 'house' represents 'family' and a Muslim's home is regarded as Sacred and private. There is an inherent tendency in human being towards privacy, the most important of which is realized at home. Therefore, if privacy is trespassed at home, it may no longer serve as a home. As traditional houses have assumed a more architectural manifestation due to religious principles, identifying these principles and converting them into housing rules and regulations are among the major concerns of urban planners. In this paper also we are going to speak about Islamic idea of privacy of housing, has tried to pay attention to Modern Architecture ideas which is the dominant style in Muslims land.

	<Abstract>Urban regeneration and renewal is one of the urban development subjects that have undergone substantial changes in last decades in its approaches and also management process. Despite these global changes, policy making in this field of urban development have been delayed in Iran. In the last three decades, the spread of distressed urban areas in Tehran and their vulnerability against earthquake caused them to be among urban management’s superior priorities. From 1990s, simultaneously with changes caused by socio-economic changes occurred after war and start of “Construction Era” in political contexts, the first urban renewal project was implemented in form of a highway construction plan by municipality with a concentrated and top-down approach. After that urban renewal policies have undergone great changes. The role of actors and power relations among them had also changes in this process. In this article, reviewing urban policy documents of these periods, we also reviewed distinctive experiences of each period in this 25-year duration (from 1990 to 2014) with content analysis and documentary studies and also case study approach. We also used qualitative methods for the analysis, particularly deep interview with experts and stakeholders of each project, analyzing distinctive indicators of studied cases, and finally revealed power relations among stakeholders of each project. These studies show that four periods are recognizable in this period in which changes in urban regeneration and renewal policy, in actors of each period and their role and power relations are clear and explain new paradigms created in urban regeneration and renewal management in Tehran. </Abstract>

	<Abstract>Development of urbanization and rise of cities and urbanism during the last decade have added new dimensions to urban issues and have led to increasing importance of monitoring, conduction of urban development and organization of towns and their surrounding regions. In the meantime, the procedures of favorable life management play the most important role in improvement of human habitats and sustainable urban development, since the regulatory factors in urban plans and procedures of dealing with urban problems stem from the efficiency of urban management. One of the new ways of management is decentralized urban management which contributes to realization of desired goals of urban administration through division of tasks and responsibilities. Furthermore, unified and integrated management of big cities like Mashhad is not possible and requires its division into small units. Provision of better and more efficient services to the citizens requires urban divisions at different levels, so that these services may be presented and managed more evenly in all parts of the city, in accordance with their hierarchy.  Meanwhile, the regionalism policy that has been implemented in Mashhad Municipality since 1386 has been an attempt to achieve this end by dividing the 13 municipality districts into 42 regions. This study is an attempt to evaluate the success of this policy and the extent of success in execution of the decentralized management. For this purpose, the efficiency and performance of different regions in Mashhad was evaluated using the DEA method and constant returns of scale and variable returns of scale methods. The results of this study suggest that so far, regionalism has failed to achieve decentralized management completely, and some Mashahd municipality districts could not fall within the efficiency frontiers, while the policy has led to increasing complexity (geographic and vertical) in the structural dimensions of the municipality. </Abstract>

	<Abstract>
Energy consumption share in construction part and dependent industries is about 40 percent of total energy consuming in Iran which is significant compared to other industries such as transportation, agriculture and therefore is of important. As energy consumption reduction and material durability improvement leads to cost reduction from one hand and environment pollution reduction on the other hand, is considered as one of the most substantial concerns in the field of construction. Energy consuming reduction needs energy consuming pattern modification besides new technology utilization for efficiency improvement of energy consumers and also lifetime enhancement of urban furniture and elements. The article results contributes to right management of energy consuming in urban environment by a brief look to solar energy utilization as a supplier and some new technologies as energy consumption reducers and introduces the best methods to manage their usage.

	<Abstract>
With increasing frequency, the developing countries and the people living there are being affected by disasters. More and more often, development efforts are being destroyed. The reason for this trend is their growing vulnerability, which in turn is the result of economic and social development processes, such as the expansion of settlements and agricultural land in risk areas. The economic and social consequences of these disasters for the people in our partner countries last for years. To break and, if possible, reverse this trend, international organizations, governments and NGOs in the developing countries are increasingly upgrading the priority of disaster risk management for policy, and taking concrete preventive measures to reduce the risk to the population. This paper examined the concept of disaster and its management in the light of sustainable development with particular reference to Iran. It enumerated the different human and natural phenomena that could be characterized as disasters. It was discovered that, while hazard and/ or disasters possess anthropogenic origins, their consequences are felt on both human and the physical environments. In all cases, the human tolls have been significant. The paper highlighted the important elements of a typical Disaster Management Information System in Iran. After presenting a typology of disasters in Iran, the paper, advocated for a workable disaster management information system.

	<Abstract>The growing trend of rural waste generated in the country requires careful considerations about rural waste management and emphasizes its role in preserving the environment. Due to the large number of villages and small amount of the rural waste, collecting rural waste needs spatial planning so that it could cover a vaster area through economic and shared use of equipments. The main goal of the present study is to examine potential assessment and location of rural waste management system in Ilam province. Methodology of the research is a combination of developmental and measurement methods whose dominant approach are the measurement factors. Statistical population of the current study included all the residential villages, which were 627, overall, and all of them were examined throughout this research. The required information was accumulated through a questionnaire. Village chiefs (head of the rural administrations: 398 people) and informed people (in villages without an administration: 229 people) and members of the village council (390people) were the ones who filled out the questionnaires. Additionally, in order to define the appropriate standards of collecting village waste, the required data was collected from among 65 directors of the village ::::union::::s, municipality experts, rural administrations’ members, and the City Hall of Ilam province. To determine the satisfaction level of villagers with the quality of services provided by waste management system of the village, a single-sample Chi Square Test was prepared. Besides, in this study, for assessing scenarios for covering the services of waste management system of the village, network analysis in Arc GIS software has been used as well. Results of the research indicate that although 26 villages in this province did have the equipments for carrying the waste, these services are only used by villages that directly own the so-called equipments, and other villages of the province are deprived of that. Besides, the results show that if the present equipments are properly allocated and used, relevant services can be provided for all the villages of the province.</Abstract>

The Diamond reveals almost every things matters for competitiveness and based on six indices and 24 sub-indices. In This article by the way of DEMATEL technique and MATLAB software the priority of 6 indices and 24 sub-indices has been showed in 47 industrial clusters (in 19 provinces) and interaction of these indices and sub-indices also has been depicted. This priority is as below: 1-Demand conditions, 2-Role of Government, 3-Factor conditions, 4- Context for strategy and rivalry, 5-Chance, 6- related and supporting industries. This priority for 6 indices and 24 sub-indices could be used as a toolkit by policy makers to enhance regional economic development so that those factors should be used that have most effect on regional economy and leased influence form exogenous factors.  </Abstract>

Todays, sustainable development is one of the principles which are considered by scholars. This means that the future of humanity is very important to maintain living standards, so that it can no longer operate as before and use the human environment. Therefore the effects of tourism should be studied perfectly to minimize its threat and maximize opportunities and strength points and this would not be realized in case of cooperation of countries. To achieve sustainable development of cultural tourism, all segments of a society should engage based on the principles of sustainable development planning to turn it into a popular culture. Sustainable development and tourism have organic communication with each other. UNWTO defines sustainable development as a kind of development which meets to needs without affecting the interests of future generations and their needs. Tourism as a social and cultural reality has both positive and negative functions in society. &quot;Enjoying the spaces, seeing different effects and customs, understanding the ways of life, preserving cultural resources are the most important functions and benefits of this sector in society. This paper intends to consider urban tourism and its role in development addresses sustainable, tourism types and defines sustainable development and sustainable urban development, urban tourism and examines the relationship between sustainable development and urban tourism  and because urban tourism is one of the most important activities and programs for sustainable development and planning for it is one of the requirements in our country due to climatic variation, historical, cultural, ethnic and religious differences.

	<Abstract>Existing models of quality evaluation in public sector are mainly derived from the approaches within private sector. These models which represented by the New Public Management (NPM) paradigm, don&amp;rsquot reflect the fundamental values of public administration, which are the very essence of the discipline and contrasting it from private sector. These core values, such as democratic citizenship, are labeled as &amp;ldquonon-performance&amp;rdquo aspects of quality by existing market-oriented quality models and, hence, are abandoned from evaluation. Following on the changes have occurred in ways of governing, which is identified as &amp;ldquopublic governance&amp;rdquo, this study suggests that quality evaluation in this area of governance should be based not only on measuring policy outputs and process, but also on evaluating political outcomes of public services, specifically those related to democratic citizenship. Government, however, plays a considerable role in governance network. Thus, the quality of ways through which government plays its role matters and, consequently, should be assessed.
