				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the issues of today's organizations is the lack of engagement of employees in work. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of perceived person–organization fit on work engagement with mediating role of organizational trust. This study is a practical research from purpose view and is a descriptive-correlation one from research methodology perspective. The statistical population of this study includes the employees of a military organization. The sample size has been calculated through Cochran formula and a sample of 176 employees has been selected through random classification method. In order to collect the research data three standard questionnaire have been used: The person–organization fit, organizational trust and work engagement, that reliability has been checked through Cronbach's alpha and validity has been checked through the Content Validity and Structural validity. Data were analyzed through independent-sample T test, one-way ANOVA and structural equation modeling with Smart-PLS and SPSS software. The results of this study revealed that person–organization fit influences organizational trust and work engagement significantly (with path coefficients of 0.778 and 0.366). Also person–organization fit effects on work engagement with mediating role of organizational trust.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Among this resources, cultural sources of soft power can be used to affect defense policy. This study aims to examine and analyze the affect Islamic Republic of Iran's defense policy in light of the utilization of soft power cultural resources. To reach this goal, data were collected using the documentary (field) and field (interview) method, then qualitatively analyzed through open and axial coding. The statistical population of this research consisted of 22 professors, experts, researchers and executives in the field of research who were selected by snowball sampling method. The results of the interviews with experts suggest that the utilization of cultural resources to the soft power of the I.R. of Iran has an efficient role in affecting the decision of defense policy makers, shaping defense policy data, and facilitating the achievement of defense and military goals. Signs of this efficiency include shaping the mental structure of defense policy makers, activating and mobilizing defense policy, trusting in God, patience and endurance, utilizing scientific solutions in policymaking, order and coherence in the process of defense policy, mobilization of people, morale-boosting, self-esteem and confidence, efficent deterrence, and so on.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The most important strategies to deal with this dynamic environment are enhancing capabilities, long-term growth and survival, seizing opportunities, facing threats and utilizing strategic management. This study aims to design and compile the strategic plan of the I.R. of Iran Army Ground Forces sport club. In this applied research, because of limitation, all managers, experts, and staff of the Ground Forces sport club (N = 45) were taken part. First of all, internal and external stakeholders, mission statement, key values ​​and vision of the club were formulated through Delphi method, meetings and several stages of strategic analysis. Then internal and external factors were defined, SWOT matrix was formed and strategic position of the club was determined. Appropriate strategies for the Army Ground Forces sport club were compiled and prioritized using the Quantitative Strategy Planning Matrix (QSPM) method. Based on the results of the research, the most important strategies that the club can implement are: empowering the club's human resources, increasing the club's financial resources, developing the club's structure, developing the infrastructures, equipment and facilities of the club.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Any military action or operation, regardless of the executive section, requires command and control over it. Increasing the speed, accuracy and breadth of the operation area, the interference of human factors and technological constraints have greatly grown the complexity of command and control systems; on the other hand, the uncertainty and complexity of the operation scene makes it difficult to use traditional information analysis methods. This study aims to determining the components and indicators of command and control of the combat organization in future wars. In this applied- developmental research, the method of data gathering is survey, descriptive-analytic. Based on the type of data needed, it is a mixed method research. In this study, a valid and reliable questionnaire (validated by experts and its reliability through Cronbach's alpha 0.85) conducted among 32 participants selected among from 110 people. In the results, normal distribution of data, correlation coefficients and factor loading coefficients of the components and indices of command and control determined. The components of command and control are decisive command with 3 indices, simple schemes and instructions with 2 indices, constant communication with 3 indices and instantaneous information with 4 indices. Constant communication with mean (7.65) comes in the first, decisive commander with mean (7.44) comes in the second, instantaneous information with mean (5.99) comes in the third place and simple schemes and instructions with mean (5.41) comes in the forth.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Understanding the involved environmental elements and variables leads to accuracy, correctness, efficiency of decision making, reducing the number of active human casualties and finally, vulnerability in the battlefield. Utilization of intelligent control systems, command and battlefield awareness equipment has provided many facilities for the Army, so that effective use of these capabilities will allow for greater command of the battlefield. The overall purpose of this study is to explain how drones are used to gather information from battlefields in Nezaja battle squads. In this applied-descriptive research with mixed data analysis approach, 150 participants selected among from 260 commanders, managers and experts in the battle squads of Nezaja regional headquarters, and information and security units of the Nezaja Information and Operations Departments based on the stratified random sampling method. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using t-test and chi-square. The research results show that gathering information through various means using unmanned vehicles can greatly improve the accuracy of the collected information and can be effective in identifying threats and creating security opportunities in a timely manner, but the current capability of the Armed Forces information gathering systems (especially Nezaja) is not enough to respond to all threats and needs to be strengthened or updated.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Today, one of the requirements in modern warfare is the rapid and deliberate deployment of combat forces. The new phenomenon of combined wars and the drastic changes of the current battle scenes and the need to embark on a new operational approach cause that mobility, agility, and rapid displacement of units become particularly important, in a way that units with higher mobility under equal conditions will be more efficient. Therefore, this study aims to provide a model for military mobility based on the principles of operational research. In this research, different scenarios for the outbreak of war and subsequent military mobility are investigated, then two mathematical modeling based on supply chain are developed for two scenarios. In these multi-objective mathematical models, the primary goal is to reach the destination with the least delay and the lateral goal is to minimize the total costs. The problem is solved using GAMS Operational Research Problem Solving Software and its performance is proven. Finally, by using an example the computational results of this problem are evaluated.]]></dcterms:abstract>
