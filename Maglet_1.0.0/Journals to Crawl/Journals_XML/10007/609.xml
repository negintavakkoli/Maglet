	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;In this era that new technology has affected human life, many research scientists believe that Biophilic design can improve human well-being.  Biophilic architecture can provide healthy spaces connected with nature and reduce stress and enhance longevity. Different researchers have identified and categorized different patterns in the Biophilic design. These patterns have a wide range of applications for both interior and exterior environments with physiological, cognitive and psychological benefits. This paper focuses on the 14 Biophilic patterns connected with nature that have been shown to impact human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this qualitative study is to determine if one of the traditional mosque-schools in Iran has incorporated the 14 patterns of Biophilic Design defined by Ryan (2014). We aim to meet this objective by researching people&amp;lsquos reactions to the fourteen Biophilic patterns (Ryan, 2014) using questionnaires and assessing people&amp;rsquos connection to nature when present at the mosque.  Aqa-Bozorg mosque-school in Kashan city which is one of the oldest cities in Iran was selected as the case study. Through questionnaires we asked whether visitors felt connected to or removed from nature while physically present in this mosque-school. Data results indicated that most of the visitors felt connected to nature while they were present in the building.  We concluded that Aqa-Bozorg Mosque-school which was built long before the conceptualization of &amp;ldquoBiophilic design&amp;rdquo does incorporate these patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
