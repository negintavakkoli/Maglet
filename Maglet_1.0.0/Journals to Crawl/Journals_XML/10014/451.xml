			Due to rapid environmental changes and the large scope of project activities in the petroleum industry, project management is of particular importance. One of the essential and important factors for the success of projects is to focus on the behavioral characteristics, and in other words, the competencies of project managers. In this regard, designing a model of project managers' competencies in the petroleum industry of Iran has been considered in this research. The research methodology is an applied method, based on the goals, and is a mixed method (qualitative-quantitative), regarding to the collecting data method. In the qualitative part, the statistical population included all project managers, managers Senior, and Minister's deputy in the Petroleum industry, 14 of them were selected through purposeful sampling and using snowball technique as a statistical sample of the study. The data collection tool was a deep interviewing in qualitative part. Content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. The reliability of the qualitative part considerd by responder's review. In the quantitative part of the research, the statistical population of the study was composed of all poject managers working in the Iran Petroleum. of the oil industry project that had enough experience in the field. Among them 170 persons were selected randomly as a research sample. The data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire in the quantitative part. The results of quantitative analysis led to the production of 394 key concepts that were categorized 152 items in 15 main components. Finally, these main key categories were classified into six key items: 1. background factors, 2. environmental faualctors, 3. causal factors, 4. pivotal phenomenon 5.Strategies, and 6. achievements and outcomes. The quantitative results showed that the amount The fitness index for the whole model was calculated as 60percent, which indicates that the overall fitness of the model is acceptable.

			<abstract>
			&#160;The aim of this research was to develop a retirement management model in the Workers' Refah Bank. In terms of its purpose, the method is a combination of the phenomenological method in the quantitative part and descriptive-correlation method, in the quantitative part of research. The statistical population of the research in the qualitative section has been 39 people including: close-to-retirement (15 people), during retirement (8 people) and retirees (16 people). Snowball method has been used until reaching saturation of information. The population of research in the quantitative section for close to retirement stage was 115, for retirement stage, 30 persons and for after retirement stage was 1175 people. The sample size was 92, 28 and 285, respectively, based on random sampling for each of these three groups. The data collection tool was semi-structured interview in the qualitative part and the questionnaire, in the quantitative part of research. Validity of the questionnaires was reviewed by using content validity-contextual validity as well as structural validity. The reliability of the questionnaires was calculated through Cronbach's alpha, which was calculated for all three questionnaires above 0.8 which indicates their good reliability. &#160;In order to analyze the data in the qualitative section, the 7-step quantitative method of Colaizzi was used and in the quantitative part, statistical tests such as factor analysis, mean and variance test, cross-sectional test and model quality test were used. Finally, dimensions and components of our model were identified and confirmed for close-to-retirement (concerns, expectations, and expectations) during retirement (concerns, needs and motives, expectations) and for after-retirement (challenges, expectations, personal strategies). &#160;

			<abstract>
			The present research aimed to analyze instructional design,workplace learning, and selecting the optimum model of learning for human resources training in petrochemical industry.The previous roles have become faint and new opportunities have appeared in petrochemical industry by starting the process of privatization and changing the nature of the company from holding to a governance and development organization. So, the main questions in this study were: what is the similarity among the world popular models about instructional design and workplace learning models? What is the most adaptive model about training and workplace learning in petrochemical industry? Therefore, a qualitative meta-synthesis approach has been used to reply these questions. This process was conducted in two steps. Its first step was conducted by Sandelowski and Barroso method in 2007. The second step was conducted by analysis of documents, observation, and experts' views using Maxqda software. Finally, the related adaptive model to the characteristics of petrochemical industry was offered including five dimentions of: performance analysis, performance design, performance development, performance implementation, and performance monitoring which were adopted from 70:20:10, Mager and human performance technology models. Regarding the dominant systematic approach in instructional design and workplace learning model, and considering of performance conception in all designing processes, it seems that the present study,as the first study in this field, can have an effective role in organizational training.t

			Productivity is the key indicator of the performance of organizations at each level, which is considered a mental concept. By changing the patterns of thought, one could hope to improve productivity and change individual and organizational performance. A closer look at what common values, attitudes, norms, and beliefs among members of the organization will make everyone consistently work towards the goals of the organization intelligently. This is of particular importance in the oil industry, which is the economic reliance of our country. This research aims to provide a framework for the native culture of productivity, with a qualitative research approach. For this purpose, after studying the history of research and performing semi-structured interviews through targeted sampling among the experts of the National Iranian South oilfields Company and University, the dimensions of the native framework of the culture of productivity were determined through content analysis of directional and tabular content. Finally, a coherent framework based on organizational values ​​(including the value of a tool that includes &#34;ethical or interpersonal values ​​and merit values ​​or social adequacy&#34; and ultimate values ​​that includes &#34;individual values ​​and social values ​​or interactions Interpersonal &#34;) has been constructed. Also, the attitude (including beliefs, emotional dimension and behavioral dimension), norms (including formal norms (law), informal norms (habits) and social norms (customs)) as well as symbols (including stories, customs, physical symbols and Language) were presented

			<abstract>
			Awareness of employees’ attitudes has always been used as one of the important management tools in organizations. Because, employees’ attitudes can affect their behavior in the workplace. Therefore, it's important to understand what factors can affect it. In this regard, due to the increasing level of employees' maturity in many organizations and becoming knowledge-based, two factors of organizational trust and psychological contracts in this research have been considered and their relationship with employees’ attitudes has been studied. In this process, by analyzing the theoretical foundations and the relationship between the factors and components constituting each of the variables studied, the conceptual model of the research has been extracted and tested in one of the companies of the National Iranian Oil Company. The research method used in this research has been descriptive correlational. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between the three variables of organizational trust, psychological contracts and occupational attitudes with each other. Also, the mediating role of psychological contract in the relationship between organizational trust and job attitudes was also confirmed
