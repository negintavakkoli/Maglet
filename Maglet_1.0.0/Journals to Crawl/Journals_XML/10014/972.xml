The human resources of any organization are the most valuable factor of production and the main source of competitive advantage, so planning for its development is essential. This study was designed to provide a model for human capital development. The research is applied and descriptive in terms of data collection. This was a descriptive-descriptive survey research using a semi-structured questionnaire and interview. In the first stage, an open questionnaire was prepared to identify the human capital development status in Iran Ministry of Petroleum of Iran. Then, a second questionnaire was designed to extract the relationships between variables, to determine the weighting coefficients of the indices and to present the mathematical model of the research.The statistical population was the experts from Ministry of Petroleum of Iran and based on the specific conditions, a number of its experts were selected as statistical sample. Systems dynamics approach was used to design the model. By using Vensim software, scenario writing was done. Finally, six scenarios were considered and among them &#34;Improvement of training and development software programs&#34; was identified as the strongest scenario and the &#34;Improvement of staffing capability&#34; was selected as the most attractive scenario. According to the results, the Ministry of Petroleum must first empower its staff to develop its human capital. Since empowerment is both objective and subjective, therefore, employees' mental capacity and self-esteem must be enhanced by increasing their skill level and empirical ability to achieve an acceptable level of productivity.

Nowadays, psychological traits of managers are among the factors that influence the success of organizations and are a key element of human resource empowerment. The current research aimed to identify psychological traits of Top managers in Oil fields of West Azerbaijan province which has been studied by the combined method (quantitative - qualitative). In the qualitative section, postmodern paradigm, phenomenological strategy, and latent content analysis technique by semi- structured (in-depth) interview (to the theoretical saturation level) with 16 cases of top managers and&#160; purposive sampling method was used for sampling and theoretical saturation was obtained from interviews with 10 individuals. In the quantitative section, using the structural equation modeling by partial least squares method, the reliability and validity of the obtained tool was confirmed. The interviews were analyzed through open coding and axial coding using MAXQDA12 and the Smart Pls2 software has been used to confirm the tool. The psychological Traits of Top Managers in the study community were identified in the four components of altruism, ambition, foresight and compatibility with others and a structural model based on these components was presented and the reliability and fit of the newly created model were evaluated.

Talent management is one of the most important challenges faced by management of companies. Uncertainty in predicting competencies that are critical for companies and the inability to accurately estimate the voluntary of talents turnover, has required adapting concepts from the supply chain management, such as supply and strategic sourcing in talent management. The purpose of this research was to cluster the job occupations of the National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) in order to provide suitable strategies for sourcing talents in each cluster. This study is considered a quantitative applied research. The research strategy was c-means fuzzy clustering method. The statistical population was all human resources staff in NISOC and the statistical sample consisted of 80 experts from human resources section which have been selected by purposive method. Based on the findings, the job occupations were categorized into four clusters of routine, leverage, bottleneck and critical occupations, and suitable strategies for supplying and sourcing talents for each cluster were proposed.
