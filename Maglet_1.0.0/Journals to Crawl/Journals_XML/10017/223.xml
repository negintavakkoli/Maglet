			<abstract>Public administration is identified as the means of implementation of public policy and is also taken as a crucial factor of success or failure of public administrators in implementing public policy making. The success or the failure of public administrators is deeply affected by the managerial stability or instability. Moreover, managerial stability is taken as the two-dimensional phenomenon which carries both positive and negative consequences. This study was an attempt to investigate the consequences of managerial stability in Iranian public organizations. For this purpose and also in a bid to identify the positive and the negative consequences of managerial stability, in terms of qualitative and quantitative investigation, the study was conducted through administering a questionnaire and also conducting an interview. As a mixed study, this study used a questionnaire and interview to collect the required data and its content validity was assured via expert and elite consultation while the reliability was estimated using Cronbach Alpha method releasing 0.98. Finally, 28 positive and 25 negative consequences of managerial stability were also identified in this study. Additionally, the crucial consequences of managerial stability in Iranian public organizations were respectively identified including implementation of long-term policies and planning as well as resistance to change.</abstract>

			<abstract>Military site selection is identified as a technique for investigating military site capabilities in terms of a sufficiency and the appropriateness of ground, site relevancy with urban and rural utilities as well as appropriate selection of military sites. Moreover, selection of appropriate military sites requires precise assessment of ground through utilizing appropriate models and tools. This study was an attempt to select an appropriate site for military encampment of Imam Ali military university through utilizing a mixed method including GIS and LPM. For this purpose, this study was also aimed to identify and then prioritize the optimal sites of military encampment of Imam Ali military university. Additionally, in a bid to identify the effective factors affecting the site selection of military encampment, the study was also conducted through administering a questionnaire and also conducting an interview among geographical and military experts and elites. Moreover, the ARC GIS data base was obtained through digital and topography maps and then weighed through AHP decision making model. Thereupon, 10 military sites of encampment were emerged as a result of AHP and also ARC GIS data processing. Having collected the data and analyzing them based on AHP and also in an attempt to maximize the security coefficient of selected sites for military encampment, linear programming model was also run in this study. The factors including financial constrains and limitations, policies of university and commanders’ decision were also investigated in this study. Finally, from among 10 military sites of encampment including mountain, desert and jungle encampment, an appropriate site was identified and selected for military encampment.</abstract>

			<abstract>Making a huge investment on construction projects in the armed forces could lead to the fulfillment of the basic requirement and also the achievement of strategic purposes. For this purpose, some risks must be identified at the early stages of construction projects. To do so, this study was run in a bid to identify and also assess the risk management of construction projects in the armed forces through utilizing a mixed approach including multi-criteria decision-making methods. This method is taken as an appropriate means of risk analysis of construction projects and is also aimed to identify the low risk construction projects. To do so, in the early stage of investigation, the risks of construction projects were emerged as a result of library study. Thereupon, in the initial stage of suggestive approach, the construction risks were identified and then weighed up based on occurrence probability through running analytical hierarchy process as well as interviewing with elites and experts. Additionally, in the second stage of investigation, low risk construction projects were identified through investigating the effects of identified risks on construction performance and also through running VIKOR method. The findings revealed that in terms of occurrence probability, the risks of supervision, design, and construction projects and also the risk of financial issues stood at the first and second rank of indicators with coefficient of 0.38 and 0.28 respectively. Moreover, the risks related to the geographical and economic events stood at the third rank of indicators with coefficient of 0.13. Finally, a list of ranked construction projects was made through investigating the effects of risk on construction performance.</abstract>
