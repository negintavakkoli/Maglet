abstract ={It’s most crucial issues, evaluation of jointed rock masses strength for surface and underground structures behavior analysis. That’s not enough laboratory tests that was done on intact samples can’t preparing index of rock mass properties in the large scale. On the other hand, doing experience tests aren’t accepted for the assessment insitu rock mass strength, especially in the feasibility studies. While, it was happen slip surfaces in rock mass the best method to estimation of rock mass strength values is previous slides back analysis. Conventional method is used for this problem solving, Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown failure criteria. In this method essential rock mass parameters are determined with a lot method such as, engineering rock mass classification. According to the large changes of Sungun copper mine rock mass properties, for determination of mine slope material cohesion strength and internal friction angle uncertainties, effective parameters on rock mass properties are supposed as random variables statement finally for each run of drilling process rock mass classification was done. In this study, rock mass classification of Sungun copper mine slopes was done by using RMR and GSI methods. Confidence level of geotechnical parameters are determined 90% approximately. Then Monte-Carlo simulation method (MCSM) is used to produce the probability density function of mentioned random variables(C, ϕ). Result shows random variables of rock mass properties simulating were done with a suitable standard deviation and coefficient of variation.},

In present investigation, with regard to permeability of recharge zone in dominant part of the Baghmalek plain and use of considerable amount of agricultural fertilizers, pollution potential of groundwater has been assessed. In order to evaluate the pollution potential of groundwater in the area, AVI method, GOD and DRASTIC models have been taken into account. The collected results has indicated that in spite of sedimentary surfacial coarse grain distribution in relatively vast part of the area, the pollution potential is low in major parts of the area under investigation. The main influential factor for low pollution potential in tremendous part of the area is the fine and relatively thickness of vadose zone.},

abstract ={(Paper pages 451-472) Flood management and flood prediction are taken into account for a long time. There are many methods to estimate the magnitude of the flood. One of the most recent methods is using Artificial Neural Networks. In this paper, a Neural-Wavelet Network (NWN) using wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for Halil river basin in SE of Iran is reported. Furthermore, a new rainfall-runoff pattern is reported. This pattern ncludes the classification of data in the harmonic data groups and the use of Neural-Wavelet Network.The introduced pattern is analyzed by the NWN model and results are prepared with Artificial Neural Networks Back propagation and Radial Base Function (RBF) model results. Halil basin was selected to used for our model. The calculations of the R-square and root mean square error (RMSE) can control the accuracy of our computations. The calculations showed that the accuracy of the results of the Artificial Neural Wavelet Network is more desirable than ANN and RBF. It is showed that the classification of data in harmonies data and using of new pattern increase the efficiency of the models operations as well.},

title = {Dynamic compaction: An effective way in constant liquefaction, case study: dry project of Iran ship building and offshore industries complex co.}, 
abstract ={(Paper pages 473-492) One of the main reasons of destructions while happening earthquake and applying intense force is the brittle deformation of outer crust of the earth. Creep in the coastal sediments may happen by the virtue of existing cracks and fissures, unnatural movement and/or loss of the earth tolerance. This phenomenon in sandy areas may happen by increasing the pressure of gang ionic water and is called liquefaction. Studying the laboratory sample shows that the capability of liquefaction of sandy deposits can be decrease by flattening the land. One of the ways to improve the soil to increase the tolerance while applying dynamic loads is dynamic compaction. The design and usage of dynamic compaction usually depend on experiment. Dynamic compaction is an active design which needs a revision and method reformation in progress according to the reaction of the earth against the hit. In 12 parts of ship manufacturing and repairing factories bed in the Iran ship building and offshore industries complex co. located in 40km away in the west of Bandar Abbas, Dynamic compaction has been used to prevent liquefaction phenomenon. While performing of water in pressing step are happened that the following approaches are suggested: 1- To empty the water of sinkholes by a pump, 2- To perform dynamic compaction in two steps with regarding the adequate time between the steps of applying hits. and 3-Sludge taking in the surrounding areas and using large grain mixture and finally if needed to do deep drainage in a large area.},

title = {Evaluation of Engineering Geological Properties of Chapar-abad Alluvial Dam Foundation: Revisiting Sealing Problems}, 
abstract ={Considering the seepage and choosing an efficient sealing method is very important in dam projects. This issue has a close relationship with engineering geological properties of the dam site. Chapar-abad dam is an inhomogeneous earth-fill dam of 44.5 meters height, crest length about 427 meters and a reservoir capacity of 127 million cubic meters. The dam project is under construction and is located about 75 Km southeast of Uromieh city, in West Azerbaijan Province. The foundation materials include 60 meters of alluvium deposits overburden bedrock layers of carbonate units. The abutments consist of carbonate and schistose layers of Precambrian age. In order to control the seepage through the Alluvial foundation, several sealing methods were considered. The methods include grout curtain, cutoff-wall, impervious blanket, open compacted trenches, and the use of geosynthetics are evaluated. In this research using a finite element package named Plaxis was utilized. The results indicate that although the cutoff-wall is usually considered as the best method for this type of geological condition, but due to the instability of granular soils and the possibility of liquefaction capability, the grout curtain is proposed as to be an efficient method.},

abstract ={Saymareh dam and hydro-power plant are under construction on Saymareh River in Ravandi anticline, Ilam province. During boring the power tunnel which crosses the anticline, a large volume of water was encountered. This volume of water was not observed in the past. Considering the water quality of springs, water level of dam site piezometers, geological and hydrogeological inspections, isotope analysis, tracing experiments and water balance, it was concluded that the main portion of water is not supplied by the Ravandi anticline. The neighboring Veizenhar, Gavar and Milleh anticlines contribute to providing the main body of water. The most probable paths of water are not cross the dam reservoir and a localized conduit flow is not established in this area. Therefore, water leakage from the reservoir is not expected.},

Seismograms of the teleseismic events that have been recorded on a broadband seismic station in the central Alborz were used for data processing. Velocity models that were computed by using both modeling methods show analogy the depth&#160; discontinuities but differences in the absolute values of velocity. In addition, differences between computed models using different initial velocity models confirms that receiver function results are not a unique modeling method compared with the joint inversion results which show reasonable and stable values.

In order to determine the source of salinity and hydrochemical processess affecting groundwater environment of the area, 61 groundwater samples were taken for hydrochemical analysis and composite diagrams (two variant diagrams of total concentration verses concentration of major ions and two variant diagrams of chloride verses concentration of bicarbonate, sulfate and sodium), Factor analysis and saturation index of calcite, dolomite and gypsum were applied. The data indicated that groundwater is supersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite and with respect to gypsum saturated to under saturation. Regional dissolution of gypsum, anhydride and local dissolution of sodium chloride are important controlling factors of groundwater salinity of the area.&#160;},

abstract ={This paper describes the results of a study which was primarily directed to the determination of geotechnical properties of fine and coarse grain soils stabilized by lime obtained from Taleghan, northwest of Tehran to assess its suitability as construction material. Soils were treated with lime mixtures in various portions between 3 to 9 percents by weight. The samples were cured for different periods of time up to 90 days under 30&#176;c and 60 percent relative humidity. The geotechnical properties were investigated by: (a) compaction characteristics, (b) compression tests and (c) direct shear tests. The results indicated soils maximum dry densities decreased while the optimum water contents increased. The compressive and shear strength of admixtures depicted an increasing trend. It was observed that addition of 6 percent of lime caused a significant increase in strength properties of CL and SC grain soils. However, the SC soil yielded the best results.},
