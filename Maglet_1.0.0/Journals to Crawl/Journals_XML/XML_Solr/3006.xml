Employee silence and indifference towards the fate of an organization and its programs and lack of effective understanding between employees and management is an alarm of imminent reduction in organizational performance affecting the whole society at a macro level. This research attempts to provide a model to cover different dimensions of organizational silence. Organizational silence management is an important part of organizational behavior management which directly affects organizational decision-making. Survey research method and structural equation modeling were used and data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. The sample consisted of 354 male and female employees of the headquarters of the Iranian Social Security Organization. The questionnaire was designed on the basis of existing theories and using exploratory factor analysis method in 174 items. Using confirmatory factor analysis method, the components were confirmed and the final model was determined after confirmation of the components and sub-components. The final model offers a way to understand organizational silence and helps managers and policy makers reduce this phenomenon in their organization and create the spirit of work and effort among their staff. Managers can utilize this theory to eradicate organizational silence. This theory helps organization theorists achieve testable hypotheses in more comprehensive research.</field></doc></add>
