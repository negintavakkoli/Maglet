			<abstract>
			One of the most important and significant issues in urban transportation is the issue of mobile car parking in the city. The need to pay attention to this has led to the introduction of several strategies in recent decades to organize and manage the condition of car parks in urban areas. Meanwhile, attention to modern technologies and their role and position in the management of these spaces is increasing day by day. In this regard, perhaps one of the best intelligent parking lots in the world is camera-based parking lots, which has provided significant capacity for urban management, both in terms of urban transportation management and revenue generation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and importance of intelligent camera-based parking lots, focusing on urban spaces and extracting the necessary grounds and strategies for the use of urban management in the better use of this type of parking. Therefore, interviews were conducted with 16 academic and executive experts in the fields of urban management and transportation, and then, using the thematic analysis method, six central codes were identified as the main areas for launching this type of parking. In the next step, using SWOT analysis method, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to using smart cameras in locating parking spaces in the city are analyzed and the most important strategies necessary for city managers to use camera-oriented parking lots are extracted. Finally, using the QSPM quantitative programming matrix, key strategies were selected and prioritized.

			<abstract>
			Corporates provide different dates for presenting information about financial status and future prospects of corporate to stockholders. Stockholders and stock market participants consider the information obtained from the corporate as good news or bad news and they react on this basis. In recent years, corporate programs have been considered by analysts and accounting researchers in order to maximize the positive reaction of the securities market to good performance of corporates and minimize inappropriate reaction to their negative performance. In this research, multivariate regression model was used to test the hypotheses. The statistical population was Tehran Stock Exchange corporates. After Sampling, 120 corporates were selected during the 2014-2017.According to the results, some managers change the timing to hide bad news. The obtained results showed that there is a direct relationship between the negative reports of earning prediction and its announcement time on holidays. This relationship is positive and significant statistically. Morever there is a direct relationship between the positive news reports of earning prediction and its announcement time on usual days (Exchange working days). Therefore, unusual accumulated profits have an economic consequence, and this shows that it can affect investors' decisions as a criterion.

			<abstract>
			Residential investment is the main component of investment and has a crucial rule in output and employment. The residential investment is affected by macroeconomic shocks. This paper provides an empirical assessment of the pace at which housing investment has responded to different macroeconomics shocks in Ian in the 1978- 2017 period by using the BVAR method. Four macroeconomic shocks are introduced to the model i.e. exchange rate, monetary, fiscal, and oil income shocks. The Sims-Zha (Normal-Wishart) was recolonized the most appropriate prior function for our data set. The Impulse response functions reveal that one standard deviation positive shocks to exchange rate, interest rate, government expenditure, and oil income initially increased housing investment and then gradually returned to its steady-state value. Oil price and monetary shocks had the shortest and longest duration impact on residential investment.&#160; The highest volatility in residential investment created by the fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and oil income shocks respectively. The results indicate that the policymaker should consider the difference in the amount and duration of the impacts of four macroeconomic shocks on residential investment in the policymaking.

			<abstract>
			The historic core is part of the city's integrity that has not grown and worn out in the process of urban development in line with the needs of the day. In order to solve the problems caused by the phenomenon of urban burnout, several approaches have been proposed, none of which have been able to permanently eliminate or control this phenomenon. Meanwhile, the urban regeneration approach has been considered as a different approach with a comprehensive approach and a coherent and integrated approach to restore the trend of past economic growth, taking into account the sustainability dimension. The aim of this study is to explain the socio-economic strategies of urban regeneration in historical contexts. The research method is descriptive-analytical and library and survey methods have been used to collect data. The results of SWOT model showed that the final score of strengths and weaknesses is equal to 2.81, which is slightly higher than the desired average (2.5). The result is that the historical context of Semnan is strong in terms of internal factors; Therefore, it is possible to use the existing potential and actual power in order to adjust the threat points and weakness in order to revitalize. The results also showed that the total final score of opportunities and threats was 2.97, which is slightly higher than the average score (2.5) as the final score of strengths and weaknesses. As a result, the opportunities in the historical context are greater than the threats, and therefore, in order to revive the historical context, opportunities or situations can be exploited and the factors that cause the threat can be avoided. Analysis of internal and external factors showed that the offensive strategy (maximum-maximum) has been adopted as the most important strategy in urban regeneration policy in the historical context of Semnan.

			<abstract>
			Distressed urban areas suffer from a wide range of economic, social and physical issues and urban regeneration can be a proper response to these unfavorable conditions. District ten of municipality of Tehran (DTMT) located in central area of Tehran and 55 percent of its area is covered with decayed texture. As a result of diversity of tasks of urban management, there are numerous stakeholders involved in the urban regeneration process. This paper is practical in term of the goal, analytical in term of nature and survey in term of data collection. This paper seeks to answer what are the main challenges in the way of urban regeneration management in the DTMT? To answer this questions; First, theoretical and experimental literature on urban regeneration management was studied and features of DTMT as our case study were assessed. Second, the challenges of urban regeneration management in distressed textures of this district were identified through interviewing and content analysis method. Then, by open coding method, the identified challenges were classified according to two domains: spatial territory and urban functions. Drawing up a network of relationships between identified challenges proved that there are dominant relationships between them. In the next step, by PESTEL analysis and Analytical Network Process (ANP), it was determined that the conflict of interests between Renovation Organization of Municipality of Tehran (ROMT) and municipality of Tehran district ten and also the lack of adequate funding in ROMT are the main challenges in the way of urban regeneration management in the DTMT.
