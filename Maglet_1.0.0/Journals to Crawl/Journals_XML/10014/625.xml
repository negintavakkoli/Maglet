	<Abstract>The purpose of this research was to preparation the theory of managerial competency using grounded theory. The 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 managers selected purposefully (maximum variation sampling) from among the different levels of management in Isfahan Gas Company. Also, Gas monthly magazine, web sites of&#160; National Iranian Gas Company and&#160; thirty province and&#160; job description of managers selected purposefully (theoretical sampling) and studied. Then based on grounded theory, in the open coding phase, concepts were collected and categorized into 8 main categories and 78 sub categories. In the phase of axial coding, the link between these categories were determined in the form of coding paradigm under titles of causal conditions, core phenomenon, mutual action/reaction strategies, context, intervening conditions, obstacles, and the consequences of managerial competencies. In the selective coding phase, the story line was sketched out and the propositions were generated. FinallyØŒ theory fitting accepted.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>The present paper tries to identify and evaluate the social responsibilities of IIES, as a Scientific-Research Institute which has the responsibility of performing functional and Strategic research for Iran Oil Industry. In the current paper, the stakeholders are divided into two groups, internal (Including the managers, advisors, faculty members, researchers and the other staff of IIES) and external (Oil ministry's staff, Employers, Executives, Consultants and external partners, professors and participants in the educational courses, website and library users, and university students who look for support of their thesis ). This study has combined survey technic as quantitative and group interview technique as qualitative method. The Statistical Society of this study consists of 120 people, 60 internal and 60 external stakeholders, whom are selected by Non-probability sampling and available samples. According to the results the evaluation of both groups of stockholders from IIES&#8217;s performing its social responsibilities, was average. Moreover it is suggested that creating consult groups in various research areas plus making a policy council with stakeholder&#8217;s participation will improve the indexes of social responsibility in IIES.</Abstract>
