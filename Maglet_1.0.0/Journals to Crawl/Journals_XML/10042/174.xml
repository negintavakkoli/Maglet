			The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the variables dependent on the location of a residential block in an urban area based on the concept of accessibility and the price. For this purpose, based on the researches, 11 effective variables and their calculation method were identified and according to the experts&#8217; opinions of the transportation and urban planning field, the weight of each parameter was determined by the method of the pairwise comparison matrix analysis of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In the next step, with the overlapping of ArcGIS software analysis and the factors&#8217; weights, the impact of each factor and the overall set of parameters in a metropolitan area was evaluated which blocks were classified into three categories of good, moderate, and poor accessibility. In this study, District 6 of Tehran metropolitan was selected as the case study. The results show that, based on the analysis of variables, the trend of rising housing prices in the region and the value of block accessibility act unlike each other, which by moving toward the north of the region, despite the decrease in the level of accessibility, we will face a rise in housing prices. Meanwhile, among the variables, the &#34;affordability level&#34; of the neighborhoods, which after the &#8220;Topography&#8221; of the region has the lowest weight among the indices, has the highest correlation with the trend of price change, which indicates the dependence of the price on other market variables.

			<abstract>
			One of the basic preconditions for planning to improve the quality of life and increase the level of sustainability in different societies is identifying the factors and elements that influence urban biodiversity. The economic dimension of livability is one of the most important dimensions affecting the quality of urban life and its promotion. Therefore, the present study is based on descriptive-analytical approach following two main aims: A- Identification and study of the status of economic indicators affecting the livability of the Tabriz Metropolis, B- Leveling economic indicators affecting the livability Tabriz Metropolis and providing appropriate model with livability of Tabriz Metropolis. In this research, the indices related to the economic dimension of livability in 12 indicators were identified by studying relevant research literature and interviews with experts, then structural-interpretive modeling technique and MICMAC software were used to express the relationships and type of indicators. Finally, to evaluate the status of economic livability of Tabriz Metropolis, one-sample t-test was used. The results of the study show the indicators of job security; enough income; proper employment opportunities; appropriate employment and opportunity to earn money were the most effective indicators on improving the livability of Tabriz Metropolis. In addition, the economic livability of the Tabriz Metropolis is low and unacceptable; among the 12 variables of research, only two variables, the ability to provide goods and services, and having a suitable job with the score of 3.10 and 3.07 are in a good condition and other variables are below the average. Therefore, exploiting a strong market economy is recommended in order to create a good job and invest in the region.

			<abstract>
			With the expansion of urban societies and urbanization, the emergence of worn-out texture of the old fabric and the margin of cities is inevitable. Given their geographical and climatic characteristics, these areas are of great importance for urban space. The city of Kerman is similar to other Iranian regions with the emergence of worn-out texture. Since the exhaustion of these contexts causes many social, economic and human problems, efforts to improve and renovate worn tissues are important. The purpose of this paper is to rank the main challenges faced by construction investors in the worn-out texture of Kerman. In this regard, using library-field method and using a questionnaire, sample views of 10 investors in the worn-out texture of Kerman city have been collected. In order to analyze the data, the fuzzy hierarchy analysis method has been used in MATLAB software space. The results showed that the main challenges faced by investors in the worn out texture of Kerman city are the economic and technical challenges of engineering.

			<abstract>
			The present study deals with designing a network governance model in Tehran municipality. This research is developmental in terms of purpose and descriptive-exploratory in terms of method. Interview tools were used to collect qualitative data. Participants in this study are managers and authorities of Tehran municipality, contractors and faculty members of universities with a history of working in the municipality. In order to design a network governance model in Tehran municipality, data-based theorization with Strauss and Corbin&#8217;s approach has been used. According to the results of open and pivotal coding, the causal factors influencing network governance include the culture of participation, political powers, upstream laws, and popular organizations. In addition, effective contextual factors on network governance include cultural infrastructure, legal infrastructure, trust building, government support, behavioral training, team capacity, and networking infrastructure. Interfering factors include management barriers, cultural and social barriers, and organizational barriers, strategic and legal dilemmas. Network governance strategies include developing information channels and environmental scanning, strengthening research and development infrastructures, developing collaborative networks for evaluating and selecting projects, outsourcing and developing citizen participation in decision making. The implications of network governance include economic efficiency, strategic development of urban services, and organizational effectiveness.

			<abstract>
			The purpose of this study is designing human resources performance management system to improve productivity of Ayandeh Bank. In the process of doing this research, qualitative and quantitative methods have been used. In the framework of the qualitative method, a number of experts in banking field were identified and, after conducting Delphi interviews with them, some of the most important bank performance indicators were identified. After designing a performance management model based on the desired indicators, a quantitative research process began. The population of quantitative section was All Ayandeh Bank employees with over 5 years of experience, nearly 2500 people, 333 were selected as multi-stage sampling. The research instrument for measuring individual, team and organizational performance and improving productivity is researcher-made questionnaire. Validity was determined by content validity and reliability was determined using Cronbach&#8217;s alpha by internal consistency. The results indicate team performance management with a coefficient of 0.68 has a more effective effect on improving productivity than individual performance with a coefficient of 0.61 and organizational performance with a coefficient of 0.52. Square multiple correlation coefficient, variable of improving productivity (0.87), indicates that the independent variables of individual, group and organizational performance management (87%) explain the variance of this variable. The results showed that based on model fit indices, the designed model is the most effective and successful model for deploying HRM model to improve Ayandeh Bank productivity.
