	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Study on international political economy of two countries, Sweden and Norway, in international interactions allows us to examine political economy of these two countries as the case study for further understanding of macro patterns of international political economy.&amp;nbsp; Thus, understanding the power of influence of international developments in two economic and political areas in internal relations of countries refers to one of the necessities in this research. The present research displays how a constant pattern such as the welfare state pattern can change under influence of global relations or loses its some principles, i.e. the vice versa of this rule is true. In other words, we face impact and effectiveness of the two sides of the exchange. Without doubt, movement toward pattern of welfare state generates behaviors, patterns and considerations at the area of foreign policy of Sweden and Norway, which we will examine them in this research. However this multi-variable equation has not yet on the stage of final settlement and in some cases the relation between Norway and Sweden has not yet defined with the developments in the new world at the area of international political economy, definition for what going on is required to understand this complexity and the reason for creation of some ambiguities. Definition for political economy of Norway and Sweden as two countries with the most welfare worldwide reveals the necessity to conduct this research.&amp;nbsp; Since Norway and Sweden have a distinctive pattern in their welfare services, measurement of the relation between these distinctive patterns and common patterns which have conventionalized at the international economy is considered a major concern. Ultimately, this research is the necessity for our country to use the interactive pattern existing in &lt;em&gt;Scandinavian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;countries at the area of international political economy. however, there are huge differences between our country and &lt;em&gt;Scandinavian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; countries in terms of geographical position, population size and financial facilities, it can use some of the patterns of welfare state in our country and some of the behavioral patterns of Norway and Sweden in international relations to progress the political and economic relations of our country in international system.&lt;/p&gt;
