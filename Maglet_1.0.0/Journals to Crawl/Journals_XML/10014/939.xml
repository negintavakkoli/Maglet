This study tended to provide a comprehensive and systematic model for SHRD based on the CIIP model. To this mean, a targeted review of the definitions, frameworks and models of (SHRD) was carried out. The research method was qualitative meta-synthesis. For data collection, secondary data sources called previous documents were explored. The method of data analysis was a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The study population consisted of all the articles on the SURD topic, published in ISI journals, books and foreign dissertations between the years 1989-2017. Based on the CIIP framework, researchers recognized several subcategories for each of the four categories of &#34;context&#34;, &#34;input&#34;, &#34;process&#34;, and &#34;product&#34; mentioned in various foreign studies, repeatedly. As a result, a final integrated model was presented and validated on the basis of these categories and relevant subcategories. This metamodel is applicable to HRD professionals to help them determine which &#34;contexts&#34; and &#34;inputs&#34; are required to consider before a successful implementation of strategic human resource development, to help them determine the required &#8220;processes&#8221; and &#8220;mechanisms&#8221; during implementation, and to help them determine the final products.

Among employees of NIDC, 211 employees participated in the study. Data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) and using SPSS-21 and AMOS-21 software. Fit indices showed that the proposed model was fitted to the data. The other findings with confidence interval of %95 indicated that variables including: trust/respect climate with coefficient of .168, discretionary decision making with coefficient of .397, and performance feedback with coefficient of .193 were positively correlated with self-determination. In addition, discretionary decisions making with coefficient of .333, and performance feedback with coefficient of .215 had a positive correlation with thriving at work. More analyses revealed that thriving at work was correlated with both job performance, with coefficient of .302 and organizational citizenship behaviors, with coefficient of .239. Mediation analyses indicated that trust/respect climate, discretionary decision making, and performance feedback had an indirect effect on job performance and organizational citizenship behaviors through self-determination and thriving at work.
