This study aimed to assess performance of the cadets graduated from Imam Ali University in terms of their efficiency in six dimensions including morale, scientific—cognitive, military—educational, intellectual, social and physical capabilities. Based on theoretical foundation and conceptual model, a pertinent questionnaire was developed and validated in terms of validity and reliability indices.
As an applied and developmental research in design and descriptive—field one in method, the study involved originally 450 participants out of army experts and recently graduated IAMU cadets and commanders.  205 were selected based on stratified – random sampling through Kocran formula. The data were fed to SPSS 19 software. The findings revealed that the experts confirmed 100 performance indices out of 221 indicating statically significant relationship among them; all supporting various significance ratio among them. The participants revealed the highest performance ratio in "faith", "discipline", and "training" and indices like strengthening spiritual and religious insight along with military preparation showed the most significant loadings. However, certain weaknesses and areas of vulnerability were explored which require remedial attention so that the university efficiency can be solidified and directed in a progressive trend. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Every year a large number of male youths join the army to offer compulsory military service they are then required to attend preliminary military training course for two months so that they can get prepared for main service. To this end, this study addressed the effect of such courses on their psychological empowerment.
For this purpose, 230 soldiers were randomly selected from one of the training centers affiliated to the ground force and were studied based on a quasi- experimental research run based on spirit’s five-factor model.
Paired t-test was run to this End which revealed significant effect of the courses on their psychological development. This means that the main and three minor research hypotheses were supported, but the minor hypotheses addressing autonomy and effectiveness were rejected, insignificant effects are attributed to factors such as average age (i.e.25.1), short-term nature of the course, prior academic achievements, job experiences, particular conditions in the training centers and negative effect of the training course in certain areas. However, the course effectiveness can be enhanced in the light of observing the suggestions made. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[War has ever been and will be an enduring concern for mankind. In line with this, the Islamic Revolution of Iran propagated state sovereignty and independence in light of Imam Khomeini,s lofty approach, prediction of any possible enemy threats and adopting effective counter- measures.
Given the state political centre, Tehran receives prime importance in this process. Therefore, the study was concerned with how to take the advantages of Tehran egresses when there is meta- regional threats' leading to asymmetric wars (i. e., bombardments and missile fires).
As a qualitative research, the data were collected through an interview and available resources and analyzed in terms of content. The findings showed that there is no end to war, which necessitates preparations for it. Meanwhile, the study resulted in a set of applied approaches on how to take the advantages of the egresses.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In social science literature, power is taken as a relative concept used for description of invisible or controlling power exercised by a man or secondary unit of an organization with respect to others. Managers play a key role in the development of organizational culture, they are supposed to have sufficient authority to manage the behavior of their staff members and employ that authority rationally regarding the organization situation and culture.
As an attempt in this line, this study aimed to identify the most advantageous type of power being employed by managers and commanders. To do so, an AHP approach was followed to explore their prioritization of power employment. As an applied- field study in design and methodology, respectively, this study was run through administering a questionnaire for data collection purpose from 60 randomly selected participants. The findings revealed that power of Islamic authority (Marjaeiat) is still judged as the most welcomed and accepted power type for managers and organizations. It is hoped that the findings can be of use for researchers, manager, and commanders.]]></dcterms:abstract>
