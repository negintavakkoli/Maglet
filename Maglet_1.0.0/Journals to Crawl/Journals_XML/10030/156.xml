In contemporary Poetry, especially in Gheisar's poems, various political, social and economic factors are included. Moreover, the content of these poems is closely related to revolution, war, martyrdom, and the regret of being left from martyrs' convey. However, there is a pressing need to investigate literary factors from a formalistic and objective stand point. One of the formalistic aspects in analyzing poems and literary texts in general is foregrounding which includes deviation from norms and establishing norms. Deviation from norms, as a new perspective in literature and poetry, is among the most substantial aspects of contemporary Poetry. Putting These techniques into practice, the degree of a poet's success becomes clear in developing a deep sense of freshness, more coherence and systematization in a poem, as well as reinforcing the musical dimension and leaving deeper impression. This paper attempts to answer the question whether Gheisar as a poet and artist has indeed created a piece of art in his poems in terms of deviation from norms. If so, in what dimensions has he used this artistic technique more frequently?&#160; A follow-up question is an evaluation of his work from this perspective. Since Gheisar's poems can be discussed adequately from this perspective, in terms of deviation form norms, their style, dialect, terminology, syntax, written format, semantics, temporal and phonetic aspects are also investigated.

The studies of language categorization demonstrate that there is no direct relationship between the rhetorical and semantic-intentional categories. A major part of the difficulties in literary concepts go back to the lack of knowledge of secondary meanings of the semantic-intentional categories of the sentences. The purpose of the present research is to explore the semantic-intentional aspects of the interrogative sentences in Shams' Ghazals. The method of this research is descriptive and the data were analyzed based on the discourse analysis approach and according to library and document analysis method. The corpus includes 264 Ghazals selected randomly according to Cochran formula. The results show that Moulawi employed 27 functions out of 35 secondary functions under discussion in this research. The statistical analyses demonstrated that the most frequent secondary functions include the following: wonder, forbiddance, negative interrogation, blaming,

negation, expressive interrogation. The application or nonapplication of a number of the functions is in close association with their affinity or lack of affinity with Molana&#8217;s worldview, which has been fully investigated in the paper

Ferdowsi's Shahname, our national and ethnic narration, is a valuable m&#233;lange of myth, epic and history. Some critics have tried to divide Shahname into three distinct mythical, epical and historical parts but these three parts are so integrated that it has been impossible to distinguish them or to draw a borderline between them. For example, those stories which have been considered as historical part of Shahname by some of the critics are mixed with the stories which have roots in mythical thinking, symbolic concepts and national archetypes, yet having a tinge of myth. One of these stories is the story of Karam Haftvad. This mere mythical story is one of the most complex stories of Shahname which can be analyzed from different points of view. So many of the critics have tried to consider this story parallel to the historical realities and to find time, place and justification for it but they have hardly been successful simply because although the mythical plot of the story has been inspired by a reality, it needs mythological analysis to find this implicit reality. &#34;What is Karam Haftvad's myth saying?&#34; and &#34;where has it been inspired by?&#34; are the questions which this article tries to analyze relying on Carl Gustavo Jung's theory.

The book Javame Ahkam Alnojoom written by Abu Al-Hasan Ali Ibn Zayd Beihaqi is truly considered as a masterpiece on astronomy written in 6th century.&#160; The prose of this book duplicates a good part of the Morsel prose in terms of lexical and stylistic features of the 6th century. This book has unique stylistic features including variety of iterations, various removals, specific application of phrases and words, writing features, specific application of pronouns and arrangement of components as examined in this paper. In this book, in addition to using old Persian words, difficult Arabic words have also been utilized, At times, even some rather low frequent words which are not included in dictionaries appear in this book

Seven ordeals is one of the important topics in Persian myth. The movements in seven ordeals do not have a historical nature so that they cannot be generalized to historical movements. As myths are derived from mankind&#8217;s active mind, seven ordeals are also the result of mental needs of people and a society and are derived from the historical challenges of a nation. Seven ordeals can be considered as the outcome of the imagination and fantasy of a nation who are threatened. It can be said that seven ordeals have goals consistent with divine regulation and epic moral values.&#160; In Ferdowsi&#8217;s Shahnameh, interactions among the heroes and champions have been depicted in a very fascinating way. These heroes face various exams during their adventurous lives. These exams can be referred to as ordeals. Sometimes, these ordeals develop and some other characteristics have been added to them and have been made into a complete story. These stories are referred to as seven ordeals. It is just here that myth enters the realm of story. Our aim is here to investigate the key points and common elements of exams, ordeals, seven ordeals and seven ordeals of Shahnameh&#8217;s heroes and other epics. This is carried out on the basis of a structuralist, comparative mythology.&#160;
