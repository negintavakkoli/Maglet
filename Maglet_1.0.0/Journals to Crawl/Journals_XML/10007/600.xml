	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Garamond&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Garamond&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;One of the significant dimensions of human&amp;rsquo;s social growth is his moral development. The human being not only is a rational and intellectual being, but also is a moral being. His morality has its origin in his sociability. The human being not only is self-centered and concerned about his own interests and well-being, but also is concerned about others&amp;rsquo; interests and their judgment of his actions and behavior. In addition, emotional perception of moral and ethics is also concerned about the importance of emotion in a moral approach; therefore, when we, as human beings, draw a line between emotion and intellect, and consider them as totally unrelated, we are actually heading in the wrong path. The results of this study revealed that the main categories of moral action consist of: knowledge management, decision making, individual&amp;rsquo;s will, coherency of moral perception. In addition, the main theme which was derived is culture. The culture theme was the most important theme derived from this study. This study tried to investigate Blasi&amp;rsquo;s moral action theory in the context of Iran.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
