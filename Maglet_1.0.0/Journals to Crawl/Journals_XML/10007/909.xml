Compilation of administrative plans and implementation of strategies is almost among the concerns of the managers and programmers. Deduction of plans from development master and minor plans is too much time-consuming. Moreover, areas of activity and types of medium for tourism are extremely various therefore, in many tourism centers, development programmers compile criteria and indices calling them tourism per capita. In this article, attempts have been made to compile some of the more related per capita to tourism industry.

	<abstract language="eng">
Today human is engaged with a great crisis as a result of his unbalancing the life, neglecting indigenous and environmental factors, and hegemonic behavior toward nature. This has ended to creation of an approach called sustainable development whose main aims are to meet the essential needs, improvement of life quality, and better management of ecosystems. Obviously it is meaningless to discuss sustainability and sustainable development in the absence of cities and urban life. Cities are counted for as the main reasons for unsustainability the world over, however urban sustainability and global sustainability are the same concepts.  Therefore, knowing key elements to reach this station is necessary, whereas recognition and prioritization of effective key elements in sustainable development is strategic and entails economic, social, and health-related results in the sequence of time. The current study is descriptive-analytic in which attempts have been made to estimate the importance of main indices of sustainable development based on the opinions of elites using a fuzzy hierarchical analysis process technic. Analysis of the data shows that from among main indices, urban health, desirable governmental system, and sustainable environment are respectively of the highest importance.

Existence of  a master budget law, defining and ratification of aims and activities of different organs if the government by the law-makers considering the rule of law, implementing auditing order based on performance, giving enough power to the legislative assembly, and government’s reciprocity, are all legal bases for to implement administrative budget planning, which are studied in this article while they are not completely met in the country’s provisions because of structural and legal problems.

The results of this study suggest that the use of modern technologies in construction, infrastructure compatibility and similarity of culture and identity is of utmost importance. Because the complexity of manufacture and urban architecture shows that technology is the foundation and basis for the structure of the city Although it helps to build the architecture and the city, but only to provide adequate facilities and various and diverse needs of not culture and identity. Public understanding of science and intelligent use of technology in dealing with identity, with emphasis on the historical background, cultural, social and environmental impact will be on understanding and explaining urban phenomenon.

One type of social dilemmas is giving priority to the interests of individual or collectivity. If one ask 'why citizens prefer their individual interests to collective interests when they face conflict between them?', we can identify incidence and prevalence of disorders at different phases of the social body as possible influencing factors. Analytically, the collective interests is partitioned into three level (family, neighbors, citizens) based on hierarchy of structural inclusion and each of them is partitioned into the four phases based on Parsons AGIL framework (Adaptation, Goal Attainment, Integration, and Latency). Relying on extensive theoretical discussions, the factors affecting the priority of individual interests over collective interests were diagnosed according to the collective interests at all levels and phases of the study. 400 Zanjan citizens who were selected with disproportionate sampling method answered to structured questionnaire items about the quantity of the mentioned factors. Results showed that 48 percent of variations in the primacy of the individual interests over private interests are predicted by four identified factors (normative disorders, relational disorders, lack of self-regulation, and the lack of identification). At first, the &quot;normative disorder&quot; and then &quot;relational disorders&quot; are effective factors in increasing the priority of individual interests over collective interests, especially in the &quot;urban&quot; are.
