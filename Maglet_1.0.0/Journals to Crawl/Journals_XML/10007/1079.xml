						<title>The Necessity to Review the Model of Tehran City Management</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=47&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Choosing the type of urban management model reflects insight into relationships to be held between municipality and councils. It also considers as index for executive power and level of participation. Defining managerial style for city and conducting power down toward urban managers is regarded as significant discussion of the best managerial model. City managerial model has a close relation to creation or solution of city problems. Survey over Tehran Municipality managerial model offers that the regular model of urban management in Iran is council-manager Analyzing managerial pattern of Tehran and its features peculiarly dative selection of mayor causes hard dependence of urban management model's elements to the main structure of power. This procedure in turn exacerbates lack of civil institutions and people participation has made urban management as contest arena for political parties over national level. So, council-mayor model is suggested as the convenient model. Applying the model through masses-based procedure and communicative insight into urban problems, in one hand, over national level emphasizes declining role of the center of power and on the other hand in local level it strengthen local management, participation of local community, multi-level and multi-agent government for effective urban management. This model using deductive measures of theoretical discussions urban governance supports urban governance indicators (citizens participation, justice and taking responsibility) and elevates other indicators like the authority of urban manager, mayor power, coordination and cooperation between council and municipality, expertise in municipal body, surveillance power of council and consistency in urban management.  Using the model also, decline the dependency of political elements over national level and in an overall view invigorates institutional management the city of Tehran.</description>

						<title>The Selection of Site for Temporary Sheltering using Fuzzy Algorithms Case study: Tehran Metropolitan after earthquake, Municipal districts No 1.</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=52&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>One of the most important problems that always have been considered by the authorities in the crisis management is the selection of site for emergency and temporary sheltering. It is obvious that inappropriate site selection may lead to another disaster that is more complex than the main one. So, the necessity of planning, managing and offering appropriate options for temporary sheltering of affected people before the occurrence of earthquake is vital. The objective of this research is the presentation of the appropriate and efficient method for the selection of site for temporary sheltering using Fuzzy algorithms. For illustrating the efficiency of proposed algorithm, the municipality district no.1 of Tehran is selected as the case study. Using the results of damage assessment of the study area, the number of homeless people was evaluated 136786 people and the required shelter was evaluated 410-615 hectares.  For the selection of site, initially necessary criteria are determined. After studying the past research and receiving the expert’s viewpoints, 13 criteria were selected. These criteria include criteria such as vicinity to water resources, distance from faults and rivers, vicinity to hospitals and other therapeutic centers, and security. In this research, Fuzzy and Boolean logics have been used for the combination of the criteria (layers). IDRISI is used for the implementation of fuzzy operations and the selection of site for temporary sheltering due to its high capability in the multi criteria decision making analysis problems. Then using WLC (Weighted Linear Combination) method, the produced fuzzy layers (maps) were combined and the map of eligibility was produced. Using this map and Fuzzy logic, 17 zones with total area of 649.1 hectares were selected for temporary sheltering. The results indicated that due to applied decisive limitations in Boolean method (classic method), the number of selected sites are more than Fuzzy method. Boolean logic is not appropriate for the areas that land use has some limitations. Assessment of applied fuzzy method in this research (WLC) showed that despite the simplicity of WLC method, it has high efficiency and makes possibility of allocating different weights to various criteria due to the importance of criteria. Considering this predominance the outcomes of the selection of site using WLC fuzzy method have better resolution power. However results showed that the selection of site depends on the experience and personal judgment of the corresponding manager, therefore fuzzy logic has high efficiency.</description>

						<title>Vulnerabilities and Legal–Executive Measures Regarding Estates Possession Located in the Realms Tehran’s Urban Decay Texture Organization Plans</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=54&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>The organization of urban decay texture is a multifaceted and multi-disciplinary issue. However, the legal system regarding the organization of these urban fabric which somehow guarantees its fulfillment, has not been fully considered. It is argued that the legal barriers and lack of due possession of estate properties correspond with the relevant plans are being considered as a major executive problems. This study aims to answer the following fundamental questions: “What are the legal-executive vulnerabilities regarding estate properties possession pertaining to Tehran’s urban decay texture? What improvement measures could be adopted?” This study is based on Tehran metropolitan. Its theoretical approach has structural–functional nature. That is along with the legal and managerial structure, estate property possessions, executive mechanisms located in Tehran’s urban decay texture should be taken into account as well. This research has both applied and strategic nature and is carried out through descriptive and analytical method. Moreover, this study is based on both documentary and survey method. Moreover, Delphi and SWOT technique as well as questionnaire were applied. This study suggests that lack of urban integrated management and the existence of numerous varied legal-executive procedures are being considered as the major structural and functional vulnerabilities regarding Tehran’s urban decay texture. This in turn, invites more attention regarding support strategy. Taking advantage of strengths and combating with internal weaknesses with regard to urban management organization has high priority.</description>

						<description>Most urban planners, especially in the structuralism school believe that different phenomena can not be a separate living space and studied independently of each other. So fundamental coherence theories of urban and regional habitat can be found in &quot;systems theory&quot; made clear. This study convinced that the balance of urban space in the system of Fars and Bushehr situation is what has been done. Considering the nature of the research question is whether the article in Bushehr and Fars regional urban systems, urban hierarchy have a balance of space, so the aim of this thesis research, and enriching the consistency week in studies seeking to obtain evidence objective regarding the balance of the urban system is studied in the range to be the basis to provide a suitable model of spatial organization of urban systems achieved. The research method chosen for theoretical research approach - in which the application of systems theory and methods of descriptive statistics, inferential and planning models are used.

						<title>Evaluation of Sustainable Development Policies in Urban Transportation by Using a System Dynamics Model (Case Study: Mashhad, Iran)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=57&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Urban transport development has resulted in a massive increase in rate of accidents, more consumption of fuels and emission of dangerous pollutants, and consequently considerable costs. These issues alongside the increasing needs to transportation services a rise the necessity for gaining sustainable transportation as one of the principle solutions for development. However, recognition and prioritization of sustainable transportation policies are very important. In this article we tried to model Mashhad transportation by using a system dynamics framework. Then, 20 scenarios have been introduced for sustainable urban transportation appraisal in 5 policy groups for 20 years. In this evaluation scheme, carpooling, reducing old vehicles and improvement of public transportation have identified as the most effective factors on sustainability indicators and is able to minimize the negative consequences of transportation in the study horizon. It seems that suggestions of the current paper may be useful for decision-makers in achieving sustainable urban transportation.</description>

						<title>Social Impact Assessment of urban projects Case Study: Zafar Golchin Children's Park” in District 10 of Tehran Municipality</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=58&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Social impact assessment (SIA) is one of the newest subjects in development-related issues, which has been started with USA’s environmental national policy. This issue has attracted immense attention in last five decade (from mid 70s) through the published results in related books and articles. Social impact assessment reflects the social results of interaction between development and society, while emphasizes the necessity of evaluating the post-decision impact by urban managers before taking action. This also provides an opportunity to the people, who are influenced by this intervention, to achieve the chance to participate in designing their future environment. So, estimating social consequences can be helpful in addressing concerns of social development in designing projects. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the social consequences of constructing a Children's Park “Zafar Golchin” in district 10 of Tehran municipality. This paper is written to satisfy the policy of Tehran’s municipality, which is responsible for most of the urban projects, to consider the environmental, social and cultural consequences of the projects. In this evaluation, the method of research according to the goal is social impact assessment, and according to nature is descriptive-analytical, which studies the characteristics and traits of individuals. Also, in this paper the state of statistical society in the form of some attributes and variables after development interventions have been studied. According to the features in a park (sliding and skating), frequently usage of park by children in the surrounding complexes is one of the main functions of the Children's Park. Because of the playground in the park, mostly the children in the range of 10-15 ages use the park. So, one can claim that the most important social consequence of construction of Zafar’s Children park is positive effects of Park on kids (providing opportunities for playing, exercising, learning, reducing obesity and improving mental health). So, the kids are the most important community who are affected by the direct and positive effects of the park. Since, formerly the place of the park was a ruined place, where the surrounding residents were putting their garbage, it caused very bad odor in the area, and as a result, the second important effect of the park is its environmental effects in the area. Although, by accurate planning, the kid’s park can be a place for improving human merits, but by inaccurate and simplistic planning, it can be converted to a place which crimes will happen, and so it will have negative social, cultural and sociological on the residents. Some of the negative consequences which residents worry about are that the park will be converted to a place of accumulation of drug addicts and gangsters it will be a place for trading drugs, and formation of some illegal friendship. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

						<description>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Nanotechnology is the origin of technological developments and considers the next industrial revolution, and many countries in attempting to meet their empowerment have the technology. This technology is in early stages of their growth and does detailed predictions about the development process and its dimensions is not possible. Policy development of new technology, especially nano-related science, involves various aspects and dimensions of performance measures are research. Functional source of knowledge production, the environmental effects of their territory. Considering the importance of this issue, assessment of environmental risks in the initial stage of production of knowledge and ideas can produce beneficial effects on preventing the spread of environmental damage and the impact of a promoter of sustainable development is knowledge. The study has tried the effect of each of the environmental risk factors using fuzzy AHP are given. Then, according to the weights obtained for each factor using fuzzy TOPSIS risk levels created in the desired areas are ranked. Considering that the study results do a master's thesis is so way using factors extracted from literature research study are presented in detail. The results showed that nano-particles and nano-fibers, the greatest impact on various areas of risk and Fullerenes are having the least risk to the environment can result. Also according to the results that can be downloaded from the influence of factors causing cancer and in contact with sensitive skin and are the least effect on these factors are genetic. Performed calculations to increase accuracy in fuzzy environment using non-fuzzy computing and fuzzy computing has been done results in the ranking are very close to each other. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
