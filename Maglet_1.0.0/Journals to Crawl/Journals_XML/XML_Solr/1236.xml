The present study has a developmental-applied nature. By descriptive-survey method, the issue is investigated in large-scale commercial buildings. In this research, to assess the architectural space of large-scale commercial buildings, five criteria including continuity of activities in emergencies, costs, facilitating emergency exit, reducing the impact of explosions and earthquakes are considered. In this research, using Swara and Smart methods, the subject matter and the proposed model for evaluating the vulnerability of the architectural space are discussed. The results of the evaluation of the criteria and indicators of the architectural space indicate that the criteria for reducing the effect of the explosion, facilitating emergency exit, the continuity of activities in crisis, earthquake and cost with the weights of 0.3056, 0.2778, 0.2315, 1852.0 and 0.1543 are ranked first to fifth. Using the proposed model, the architecture of large-scale commercial buildings can be evaluated against urban threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerability and weaknesses of these buildings in each indicator and criterion.</field></doc></add>
