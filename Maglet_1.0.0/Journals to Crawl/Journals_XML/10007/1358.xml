One of the best ways to study this devastating climatic phenomenon is the use of atmospheric instability indices. The indices which are calculated with the help of radiosonde data give a fairly comprehensive vision regarding the occurrence of such phenomenon. In this study, the incidence of moderate to severe hail is investigated in the period of 1990-2010. First, the atmospheric codes related to hail phenomena were applied to extract the data, then radiosonde data in intended time were received and applying the RAOB software, the physical status of atmosphere was studied. In the studied period, two hail examples were reported on November 27, 2008 and December 5, 2008. In the first instance of hail that occurred on November 27, 2008, the status of some indicators was calculated and it was found that LCL was at an altitude of 284 meters, CCL at an altitude of 1582 meters, LFC at an altitude of 6230 meters, the ice surface at an altitude of 3278 meters, the LI index was -0.2, the K index was 25.7 &amp;deg; C, and PWC was 28 mm. In the above mentioned conditions, there was a hail with a diameter of 25.4 mm. In the second instance of hail that occurred on December 5, 2008, the status of some indicators was calculated and the results showed that LCL was at an altitude of 280 meters, CCL at an altitude of 1762 meters, LFC at an altitude of 2271 meters, the ice surface at an altitude of 2771 meters, the LI index was -1.4, the K index was 27.1 &amp;deg; C, and PWC was 23.6 mm. In the above mentioned conditions, there was a hail with a diameter of 3.6 mm. Given that in many ways, the status of most atmospheric indicators in the two above examples of hail were close to each other, it turns out that in similar circumstances, the greater the distance the ice level gets to the summit of cloud, the greater is the probability of hails larger in diameter. The value of this distance for November 27, 2008 was at approximately 6384 meters and for December 5, 2008, it was at about 5012 meters&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot; lang=&quot;AR-SA&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-bidi-theme-font: major-bidi; mso-ascii-font-family: Garamond; mso-hansi-font-family: Garamond;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
