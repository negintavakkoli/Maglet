<Abstract>Due to the growth of city population and a sharp rise in land cost, families living in high-rise buildings have been on the increase over the last several years. Therefore, people have always looked for the ways to reduce the negative health effects of living in high stories. One of the most important factors that could play a key role in reducing these effects is public open spaces in the residential areas. A well-designed open space can make them appropriate for residents’ social interactions. These spaces can be regarded as the continuation of private lives that their existence is necessary for a residential complex. The hypothesis of this study was that the residents’ social interactions decrease by gradual increase in height. International tower of Tehran was selected as the case study and the impact of increasing height on social interactions was studied. The questionnaires were randomly distributed among 70 residents of the tower. After collecting the questionnaires, the data and information related to each question were categorized. The result of analyzing the data showed that a gradual increase in height has a linear relation with the social interaction of residents. Finally, according to this relation, and also in order to prevent a decline in social interactions between residents, some strategies were suggested to promote the level of social interactions in high-rise residential complexes.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Strategic Vision in management is not a choice but a necessity. To be of this view, is to be of knowledge, deep thinking, comprehensive visioning, realistic view, and mature management competence. Management is a process which projects with scientific, realistic and comprehensive characteristics are its signs. In urban management, systematic view is an unavoidable principle. Desirable management of cities, particularly metropolitans, without IMS (Integrated urban Management System) is impossible and IMS is the system as the by-product of strategic view. This view is a burden on the shoulders of Mashhad’s managers in different contexts and issues such as urban services, and urban environment in the district of Mashhad Metropolitan. To make the ultimate use of the limited resources, this local management should naturally be able to choose its specific strategies, those strategies which are toward viewpoint of local management of Mashhad on one hand, and flourished from the missions of urban management on the other. Theoretically and methodologically, this study is based on structuralism and historic-formative analysis in macro scale and strategy, which is done through qualitative and document-library methods of research, aiming at attaining strategic programming methodology in urban waste management of Mashhad. Results show that recognition of Mashhad citizens’ priorities and requirements though creation of clean and sustainable environment must be the basis for the decision-makings in policy-making and planning for Mashhad metropolitan while is impossible without a strategic visioning. </Abstract>

<Abstract>Accessibility to urban public spaces and facilities can be one of the main factors for the users. There are a few studies in the country regarding to the subject, despite the importance of public accessibility. Public spaces are a vital part of our daily life in cities streets where we pass them every day to reach our work place, places where children play and religious locations where our holy duties take place. The main goal of this study is to measure accessibility quality to urban amenities and facilities (Neighborhood Parks, primary schools, health care centers, mosques, and sport clubs). Also the research aims to compare the quality of life in different urban structure of Tabriz. The methodology of the research is based on descriptive –analytical methods and for selection of samples, stratified random sampling was applied to select the samples. There has been a wide h in the current literature review regarding to the measuring quality of life and then the required maps were produced in GIS environment and Fuzzy technique was used to determine the quality of neighborhood accessibility to the facilities. Finally multi criteria techniques like TOPSIS and Entropy to better and easier analyses. The results revealed that there is considerable difference of among the neighborhoods regarding accessibility to facilities. Although accessibility to some of neighborhood facilities has been better in newly developed areas but the areas where rural settings still dominate some marginal neighborhoods the accessibility is very low. </Abstract>

<Abstract>Non- compliance with building regulations is one of the major abnormalities in Tehran that its effects can be seen in different aspects and levels. There are different kinds of building contraventions in Tehran that FAR contravention is the most numerous among them. This paper aims to find some reasons for FAR contravention in the city through the consideration of the effect of social, economical motivations and the monitoring system about urban constructions on FAR contravention. Therefore, six indicators including level of awareness, violation of regulations with the aim of meeting the minimum needs of housing (housing related motives), violation of regulations with the aim of gaining financial profit (profit making motives), owner's income level, experience and expertise level of developers, and the quality of supervision and monitoring are determined and the information gathered through questionnaires answered by 150 persons whose cases were under investigation in the municipality and the information are analyzed through path analysis. According to the results, the FARTHEST contraventions have been occurred due to the low level of awareness of citizens about building bylaws and the importance of complying with them in Tehran. In addition, meeting the necessity to more covered space and room for housing or working, and the income level are the principal factors affecting on the occurrence of FAR contravention in the city. </Abstract>

<Abstract>The main objective of this paper is to analyse street network structure of the deteriorated areas in order to resolve permeability problem and spatial isolation of these areas. Previous researches that investigated the problems of deteriorated areas concern about land use per capita indicated that low permeability of these areas is not about area of streets but, it is because of inadvertence towards the urban street network in developing new areas or regeneration of deteriorated areas. In both cases, insufficient network of streets and roads have been produced. The common solution to encounter shortage of permeability was widening existing streets or creating new streets. Previous research regarding resolving lake of access and isolation on deteriorated areas, have been failed because they did not carried a methodical approach toward identifying the structure problems of deteriorated areas. Regarding the above theoretical and technical shortcomings, this paper would answer to two fundamental questions: How could weaknesses of urban street structure on deteriorated areas can be round and can be resolved? Are there similar structural problems about permeability on all of the urban deteriorated areas? In order to answer to these questions, at first urban street structure of Mashhad has been analyzed utilizing Space Syntax method. This method identified the weaknesses and deficiencies of Mashhad's deteriorated structure. The results show that, there are significant differences between the structure of deteriorated areas and other parts of the city this differentiation helps to identify weaknesses in these areas. Also, analysis of urban street structure indicated that reasons of access weakness and permeability problems in various deteriorated areas are different, especially between central and suburban deteriorated areas. So, the problems of deteriorated areas cannot be resolved similarly. </Abstract>

<Abstract>Today, the pedestrian oriented movement, whose goal is to retrieve and expand pedestrian spaces on the face of the city, and to recognize and give priority to pedestrians as first rate elements of the city, has turned into one of the axes of programming and urban design. Especially with the beginning of the third millennium, renewed necessity of pedestrian movement as the most healthy, economic and dynamic method of movement and inner city transportation has attracted experts and leaders of urban affairs. Factors such as significant increase in movement time, increase in accidents, increase in sound and visual pollution and air pollution which is getting close to the borders of creating health threats for humans, are the consequences of the unstable urban transportation system. In addition, obstacles such as lack of funding for infrastructure, lack of safety and security, improper positioning of spaces and buildings, legal and regulatory obstacles and finally, lack of credibility and social status exist in the path of development of the non-motorized transportation network. The results of the experiences of other countries indicate that stability cannot be reached only with changes in design, models of utilization and management of transportation systems, but with changes in mentality and way of thinking towards identification and evaluation of possible solutions for solving the problems of transportation. Therefore in this research we first have a brief overview of the concepts of sustainable urban transport, then we study walking and cycling and their effect as effective methods of non-motorized transportation, along with strategies for reaching sustainable development in desirable urban form, in the area of 2nd Sadeqieh square ( located in zone 2 of the municipality of Tehran) which have been analyzed and evaluated using a mixed model of SWOT and Likert, in order to use benefits of applying these strategies and developing them in the country. This research has been done with the support of the Institute of municipalities and village council of the country. </Abstract>

<Abstract>Investigating the requirements adopted from effective criteria and indices for national laws and regulations is needed for urban projects execution and these projects are followed by the least standard deviation. Project success and all staffs satisfaction are in fact the most important issues in urban projects as well as all kinds of projects. The most important factor is documentation of project existance reasons, goals, roles and responsibilities, stakeholders duties and authorities in the early stages of the project which is called project charter. In this article, which has used explorative method, after reviewing the project charter literature, various templates in 42 different projects in the world are investigated. Then we design the preparation step by step and derive the needed criteria and the result of the research is a suitable pattern for project charter preparation. Regarded that most of the projects in Iran have not included a project charter, the researchers of the paper have investigated the current effective factors used to prepare four big project charters by reviewing their documents and comparing them to designed model. </Abstract>
