	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Biology has been a brilliant teacher and a precious textbook to man-made construction for thousands of years, because it allows one to learn and be inspired by nature&amp;rsquo;s remarkable and efficient structural systems. Concepts unfortunately have this in common that in general use often specifies incorrectly some phenomena. There was a turning point in each period of time which human has discovered a new sight about the world and nature order in a way, and then has presented this relation by numeral, artful and industrial language. The relation between nature and human considers different periods. At first it was bio-utilization which degrades the value of nature as a source of energy and material. After revolution in science development and attention to the damages which they made to environment, they tried to change their look to this issue and expand the mean of relation between human and nature. Birth of such word like bio architecture emphasize on the new point of view at nature. The role of nature and importance of natural resources in human&amp;rsquo;s social-economic (and even his psychological) life is undeniable, and also it is essential to note that God is the Creator and man the explorer. This paper aims to call a close multidisciplinary collaboration that promotes engineers to build more sustainable and smart structural systems for bridges in the 21st century. In this article survey the introduction of bionic architecture and related categories.&lt;/p&gt;
