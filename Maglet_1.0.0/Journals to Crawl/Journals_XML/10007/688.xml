	<Abstract>
Today human is engaged with a great crisis as a result of his unbalancing the life, neglecting indigenous and environmental factors, and hegemonic behavior toward nature. This has ended to creation of an approach called sustainable development whose main aims are to meet the essential needs, improvement of life quality, and better management of ecosystems. Obviously it is meaningless to discuss sustainability and sustainable development in the absence of cities and urban life. Cities are counted for as the main reasons for unsustainability the world over, however urban sustainability and global sustainability are the same concepts.  Therefore, knowing key elements to reach this station is necessary, whereas recognition and prioritization of effective key elements in sustainable development is strategic and entails economic, social, and health-related results in the sequence of time. The current study is descriptive-analytic in which attempts have been made to estimate the importance of main indices of sustainable development based on the opinions of elites using a fuzzy hierarchical analysis process technic. Analysis of the data shows that from among main indices, urban health, desirable governmental system, and sustainable environment are respectively of the highest importance.

	<Abstract>
As the most important greenhouse gas, water vapor plays a significant role in global warming. Therefore understanding this important climate parameter in populated area can play an important role in survey the climatic comfort. So in this research, first the spatial autocorrelation and identify behavioral patterns of water vapor pressure in South and Southwest of Iran with exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and Anselin Local Moran statistic is investigated and then the effects of this important climatic parameter on population centers is discussed. In this context, the WVP data from 46 synoptic stations in South and Southwest of Iran with appropriate length and highest resolution were used. To analyze the spatial autocorrelation, study area due to the optimal spatial resolution were divided to pixels with the dimension of 9×9 km (3,338 pixels). By programming in MATLAB software, the monthly, annual and decadal WVP were extracted for each pixel. Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested strengthening and weakening the high-high WVP clusters and Low-Low WVP clusters, respectively. So that high-high WVP clusters have extended near the Persian Gulf (Especially in the Bushehr provinces) and Low-Low WVP clusters have disappeared in southern parts of Zagros Survey and comparison of the spatial distribution of WVP clusters with temperature clusters, as one of the most important influential parameters, showed a significant positive autocorrelation in the study areaک Thus, according to the direct and indirect effects of WVP on human activities and natural environment as the basis of human activity, the establishment of population in population centers of studies area will be affected by fluctuations of WVP and this trend will be more pronounced in the future.

Today, the design and expansion of critical theory to the city, including the &quot;public areas of the city&quot; in the efforts of modern man to achieve optimal living conditions as one of the most important goals of social movements as well as the result of &quot;the richness of historical experience and theoretical results the accumulation of knowledge &quot;is. Public domain in normative concept or idea that the general theoretical framework of Habermas's communicative action and ethics of dialogue instead The public sphere of social life in which citizens can discuss important issues related to the public good (public interest) to pay. The result is the formation of public opinion. Democratic philosophers believe that this physical manifestation spaces of the public sphere, sphere of activity, communication and dialogue open and various people as well as the formation of civil life. This paper documents and logical reasoning and analytical method and the method of data collection, including library and documentary studies to examine some of the critical theory of the Frankfurt School in the city (especially Habermas, Arendt and Harvey) were investigated. In the first phase, the research findings indicate that the Frankfurt School theorists because of their similarity in opinions, including criticism of capitalism and Marxism, and criticism of modern and contemporary and positivist concepts of rationality, science and empirical evidence, human object, the loss of freedom and independence of man, which are called scholars of this school. In some of the issues and their proposed ideas such as revolution and social change agents in capitalist society and its practices, and alternative plans for a successor system, the shape of the human future in the cities and urban areas in the cities of the future changes are different. Next, the criteria and elements for the development of public areas in the city have been mentioned.

Given the relationship between landscape and health in a long time in different cultures and societies has been identified. The view leveraging as a healing approach can be useful and effective strategy in this field seem. According to the designer maximum effort in order to create the healing properties of such a perspective in the promotion of peace, contributing to health, prevent disease and also the use of therapies far superior humanistic and natural, and deserves a lot of the methods of modern man favorite is mechanized. Such an approach was made to meet the requirements addressed in the sights of urban open spaces covered in the above and given the lack of research in this area would be useful and effective tool. Therefore, in this article from the perspective of the relationship between these factors and health issues, including that of particular importance is also the lead researcher to approach healing perspective. The results show that the natural approach to health caused by Persian gardens and can be used in designing urban open spaces have the faith that can stabilize qualitative approach to urban landscapes Iran. This tendency for optimal use of nature, although at low levels, but the goal is to reduce stress and increase health and sometimes in preventing the disease on the one hand and on the other hand protect and historical heritage of our country (Garden of the Persia) and revitalization them to fertilize in the community.

	<Abstract>
There have been recent fundamental transformations in budget planning in different (specifically developed) countries due to their management style changes. In these countries there is a growing emphasis on budget-oriented performance and emphasizing on the best performance based on the ratified regulations, the executive power is obliged to present the previous performance data and also the prediction of its future performance framed with the annual budget to the parliament and request the budget managers to report the budget performance to the parliament after it is implemented. The concept of observation of the parliament has also changed. Currently such a performance does not necessarily mean the adaptation of budget performance with the budget law but its alignment and adaptation with the decided targets and plans. These countries, through a process of improvement or change, are trying to make the budget planning come closer to a performance-oriented order or some operation in which the budget credit and administrative departments relationship is clear and understandable and doing so, provide the government and parliament with a credible and reliable data support. In such a framework, efficiency, effectiveness and economization are introduced as the main targets of budget planning. In this study, the US system of budget planning is investigated as the first system presenting operational budget planning system, including a very comprehensive federal system. In this article, despite considering principals of operational budget planning, budget law and operation of analysis and finally the forthcoming challenges are presented.

However, what is now considered to be at increased tourism, “the idea of competitiveness of cities” and the feasibility of the creation and formation of global cities in the category of “urban tourism” in the subject. Accordingly, in this paper, the analytical method in the theoretical and secondary analysis of the data is used. The results show that the competitiveness of urban tourism metropolis of Tehran only amusement park in the area of infrastructure and the urgent need to develop residential complexes in this area is necessary. At the same time in the recreational infrastructure, increase the quantity and improve the quality of them, especially in terms of safety an important issue in terms of competitiveness in Tehran.
