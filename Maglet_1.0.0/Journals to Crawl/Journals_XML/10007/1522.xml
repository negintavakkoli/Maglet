	<abstract_fa>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today, Information Technology services are considered as valuable resources in all areas. For making Information Technology Management Processes purposeful and efficient in different organizations &amp;ndash as a competitive and strategic advantage (especially in organizations responsible for health care services) &amp;ndash it is necessary to recognize the level of maturity of the organization and review its processes in the field of Information Technology Services. On the other hand, finding the relations between main components of maturity and Information Technology Standards are essential to make them functional. In this paper, in addition to recognizing the present IT Management Services and prioritize them we reviewed the gap between processes and compare them to provide related maturity levels for introducing a localized model in Information Technology Services maturity in organizations responsible for health care services. Therefore, with the help of health experts and professionals working in health organizations we categorized indicators in 10 management processes and 9 criteria related to it. In addition, we evaluated overlapping levels of maturity and ITIL management processes by using experts opinions that have a high percentage of consensus in the field of selecting criteria. The aim of deriving these indicators was creating a functional tool in health organizations and paying attention to its main differences with other methods in addition to inspiring from CMMI and entering effective components on Information Technology Infrastructures Standard (ITIL) framework according to functional views in Information Technology Management Services at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The present study can be recognized an applied research in accordance with its goal. In this research, a proposed instrument is used for gathering data (ITILRA questionnaire) from health care centers of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The aim was determining the gap between current organizations management processes with an optimal one in the field of IT services (which are at different levels of maturity) with respect to the ITIL.V3 framework. For this reason, leveling joint processes between ITIL and CMMI and approving corresponding indicators at Information Technology Services Maturity Model levels were done and each criteria and processes were compared with ideal and standard situation separately. Then, we determined the highest and lowest differences rates and standard deviation for creating a localized maturity model based on ITIL. In management process, Service Desk has the most close and overlapped situation with ideal condition. In Configuration Management, the highest differences and gap was recognized, so, it should be closer to optimal condition. Service Desk belongs to Service Operations phase and it indicates the maturity level of the organization. As it was expected, it was in a very desirable condition. Configuration Management Process belongs to Translating Service Phase which stood in third place (predetermined processes) of maturity level in CMMI Model. It shows that improving maturity level of the organizations needs more efforts for reducing or omitting any gap between the current situation of the organization and a desirable condition. All these scores (by mean and standard deviation tests) obtained using SPSS software.&lt;/p&gt;
