Since energy efficiency index that is one of the targeted components in resistance economy policies has been reduces, it is necessary to design and adopt comprehensive, efficient, and integrated policies in order to improve efficiency and productivity of energy consumption in Iran. Energy consumption optimization in urban communities is affected by different factors and components. One of influential components is socio-cultural factors. This is because of an element named consumption attitude and behavior among any household’s member that has socio-cultural roots, and consequently only socio-cultural tools are effective on its change and reform, but this type of factors has been less considered by researchers in analysis of consumption behavior. In this research, energy consumption behavior in urban community has been analyzed with socio-economic approach and by using data based on experts’ view in this area, factor analysis technique, and LISREL Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) , it was analyzed exactly and scientifically. According to the results from the mentioned model, economic policies, whether price ones or non-price ones, do not have acceptable impact to improve and reform energy consumption behavior in urban community. There is a poor relationship between this type of components and energy consumption behavior in urban households. On the contrary, social and national beliefs and norms have significant impact on consumption behavior. Currently, they are main source of forming and directing energy consumption model in Iran’s urban communities. However, the potential impact of religious and moral values on social and national beliefs and norms has been proved. Given direct impact of this type of socio-cultural components on energy consumption behavior in urban society, high capacity can be regarded for religious-ethical views and values to improve consumption behavior in urban community.</field></doc></add>
