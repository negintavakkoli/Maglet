	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable assets of each firm is the brand of that firm. Whatever the  brand equity is more in the consumers&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;mind, the firm can gain more benefits from the consumers in its shadow. The continuous controlling of this concept is as a necessary step in its effective management. In recent decades, studying and searching about the brand has allocated a special position in different domains such as university and business market to itself. Most of the researchers and managers of companies have concluded that the most valuable asset of a firm for improvement of marketing is the knowledge of branding which is accomplished by investing in marketing plans and creates the brand picture in the consumer&lt;sup&gt;&amp;rsquo&lt;/sup&gt;s mind. With regard to this important, studying the effective factors on the brand equity and its effects on the customer responses with a comprehensive look which includes both dimensions is needed. In this research we intend to design an optimal model for Samsung company to study that which variables can have the most effect and also they can have what effect on the customer behavior and response. The purpose of doing this research is to introduce the conceptual model about the effect of the Marketing Mix elements on the brand equity and its relation with the customer responses. This research has been a descriptive-survey kind and the field information was collected by the questionnaire tool. The statistical population of this research includes the consumers of the audio-video products of Samsung company. The sample size was assessed according to the Coachran formula in the unlimited population including 384 samples and data analysis was done with modeling the structural equations by statistical software named SPSS and LISREL. The research results have indicated the existence of positive relation between the research variables and fitting the conceptual model of the research.&lt;/p&gt;
