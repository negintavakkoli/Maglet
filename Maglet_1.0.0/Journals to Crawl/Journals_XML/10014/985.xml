title = {A Review of Organizational Ambidexterity and Performance}, 
abstract ={The success, growth and long-term survival of an organization depend on its ability to exploit current capabilities and simultaneously explore the new competencies. Numerous articles have been devoted to the study of organizational ambidexterity in innovation, organizational and strategic management literature. Some indicated the important role of ambidexterity in organizations' performance. Others brought up that it is not so significant, and this question is yet to be answered. So far, several literature reviews and meta-analysis have been conducted on this construct, which has been focused on limited specific aspects. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of both qualitative and quantitative studies which include all types of performance and also highlight the different conceptualization of organizational ambidexterity. Therefore, this comprehensive systematic review of 134 qualitative and quantitative studies during 1991-2016 has pursued two major goals: First identifying different conceptualizations of exploration and exploitation, and second, identifying the causes of different effects of organizational ambidexterity on performance in previous studies. The review results found 15 different conceptualizations of exploration&#8211;exploitation; and also six reasons for the different results of previous research on the impact of organizational ambidexterity on performance have been identified, including measurement of organizational ambidexterity, level of analysis, research design, implementing organizational ambidexterity, performance measurement, and organizational ambidexterity conceptualization, each with its own dimensions},

abstract ={Although the employees are expected to contribute in organizations development by utilizing their knowledge, ideas, and comments, so often they prefer to remain silent. This research was designed to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between organizational silence and leadership style at Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). In this practical study, we gathered descriptive data by questionnaire, and utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to look at the correlations among data points. The random sampling technique has been used to gather 115 data points among the target population of 350 employees at RIPI. It has been used a combination of Leadership Style questionnaire (Bass &#38; Avilio, 2000), Personality questionnaire (L.R. Goldberg, 1993), and Organizational Silence (M. Vakola and D. Bouradas, 2005) for gathering data. Reliability and validity of data were investigated by using the cronbach's alpha test and AVE test, respectively. The results indicated that the transformational and transactional leadership style has a significant reverse relationship with the organizational silence, while the relationship between non-interventional leadership style and organizational silence was insignificant. Furthermore, the introvert personality has a significant direct relationship with organizational silence. The results showed that for the staff with introvert personality, the non-interventional leadership style amplifies their silence and vice-versa. The personality variable in transformational and transactional leadership style has a moderating effect on the leadership-silence relationship as well.},

abstract ={&#160; Two types of fitness and alignment are essential in human resource management. Vertical alignment that points to the consistent of HRM strategies and activities with corporate strategies and goals and, horizontal alignment that is related to the consistency among various practices of human resource management. With regard to effective results and synergies resulting from consistent and integrated HR practices, identifying the dimensions of horizontal fitness in human resource management practices, providing a desirable and comprehensive model is inevitable. The present study was carried out for this purpose by using qualitative meta-analysis method. So that the most important definitions of the concept of alignment and horizontal alignment, as well as the models and theories related to it, have been identified and investigated. Then their strengths and weaknesses compared with each other and, finally, the proposed model was designed in such a way that includes a comprehensive definition of horizontal alignment and its effective dimensions. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it combines all definitions of the concept of alignment and horizontal alignment, and investigates horizontal integrity dimensions among human resource management practices, including process integrity, architectural and configuration integrity, and executive integrity in a comprehensive manner.},

abstract ={Since the improvement of human resource efficiency can play an effective role in the efficiency of organizations, it has always been one of the main research topics.The tendency to leave the organization is one of the factors affecting the efficiency of human capital, which can be predicted using in-data models, conditions governing the organization and the factors affecting it. For this purpose, intelligent algorithms based on neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm have been used in this research to predict the tendency to leave an organization. In this regard, a standard dataset was created based on a questionnaire of employees satisfaction and the desire to leave the job in the Karoon Oil and Gas Production Company. Then, using an artificial neural network as a classifier and a multi-objective genetic algorithm, the important factors or features were selected. In the next step, an expert system was proposed to select effective features. In order to test and evaluate the neural network algorithm developed with the standard data set, the necessary training was provided. The results showed that by using the proposed model, not only the willingness of employees to leave the organization can be predicted with more than 88% accuracy, but also, the key factors of leaving the organization can be determined.},

abstract ={One of the techniques used in management is the outsourcing of activities that are not necessarily associated with success due to the lack of proper selection of the contractor. Since this technique is implemented in a large part of the activities of the petroleum industry research center, this study addresses this issue. This research has been conducted with a applied-development approach, utilizing the expert group's view of mathematical modeling of selecting contractors at the oil industry research institute with the Bernardo model. The results showed that the research institute of petroleum industry in evaluating contractors should use a two-stage model. Also, from the viewpoint of the expert group in the first phase of selection, the number of selective criteria increases, the final utility rate is reduced in the expert group agreement, but this in the second phase of the selection reflects precisely the results of the photograph. Based on the results of this research, suggestions were managed to increase the satisfaction of contractors and stakeholders in this industry.},
