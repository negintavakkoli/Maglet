Some of the required data were collected by using the questionnaire and some of them were extracted from the Municipality documents. According to the model stipulated in three forms, the results of the most complete model indicated that because of the lack of appropriate models for planning the credits and relying on the bargaining power, the allocation of the construction budget was not optimal in any years and the given values to variables do not achieve the goals mentioned in the CDS, and the credits in some subsections were considered more or less than enough, and goal programming model will be a useful tool in determining the optimal values in future years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
