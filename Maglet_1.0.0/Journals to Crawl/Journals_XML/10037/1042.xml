abstract ={(Paper pages 513-522) Estimation of engineering properties of rocks and flow rate is an important issue in rock engineering. Properties of discontinuities have considerable effect on rock mass inflow, because they are the main pass of water flow in fracture rock masses. Despite the bulky research about water flow in rock mass, there is no clear evidence as to relationships between all of these parameters and water inflow in rock masses. Neural network systems have a great advantage in dealing with complicated problems such as forecasting, classification and pattern recognition. In this paper, artificial neural network techniques were used in order to forecast Lugeon amount and Hydraulic conductivity behavior of Granodioritic rock mass of Shoor-Jiroft dam site from some characterization of discontinuities such as Rock quality designation, Fracture frequency, Aperture, Weighted joint density, Fracture zone and depth. Relationships between these factors were analyzed with Simple Linear Regression, Multivariate Regression and Stepwise Regress-ion. A Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) with back propaga-tion procedure was developed for training the network. A Dataset containing 304 values of water pressure test in Granodioritic rock mass of Shoor-Jiroft Dam project was used to train and test the network with the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. The results indicated that neural network forecast hydraulic conductivity considerably better than regression methods do.},

This model is analyzed dynamically with finite difference 2D FLAC software under vertical component of ground excitations. Then the soil is improved with cement grouting and analyzed again. Consequently, the load-settlement curves under a circular footing, due to vertical component of ground accelerations through the underlying soil, are plotted. Also the dynamic bearing capacity of natural and soil cemented foundation is presented and discussed.

abstract ={(Paper pages 543-562) When two solutions are mixed, concentrations in the mixture are volume-weighted averages of the two end-members, but the thermodynamic activities of the species controlling the water–mineral reactions are non-linear functions of the mixing ratio. Therefore, two end member solutions in equilibrium with carbonate phase could lead to a mixture undersaturated with respect to carbonate. A favorite place for this phenomenon is water table, where mixing of different waters is taking place. In this paper, Porosity change in freshwater lens of an island was calculated by coupling dissolution potential with a variable density flow and solute transport model. The effect of permeability enhancement on the rate of porosity change was evaluated. Dissolution due to this mixing takes place in water table and active edge of freshwater lens (40m from coastline). The results indicate an increase rate of 0.6×10-3 percent of porosity per year. Permeability enhancement increases the rate of dissolution and porosity change in fresh water lens.},

Wealth of data from recorded local earthquakes creates an opportunity to image crust and upper mantle in the region and then these data use for the joint inversion method in this region. We proposed to study velocity and interface structure of the crust and upper mantle in the west of Iran using local earthquakes recorded in the Kermansha short-period seismic stations at the Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran (IGUT), and the Sanandaj broad-band seismic station at the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), since 2004. The earthquakes and stations should be directed for the travel time curve analysis. Recorded earthquakes were classified along the five separate profiles and 278 earthquakes (mb≥3) separate in data (3000) and epicenter distance is 10-750 km, that corresponding travel-time curves were analyzed. Moreover, crustal velocity structure is determined based on the travel time curve of local event. So, algorithm program was written and arrival times of body waves compare with forward modeling code was written, in order to refine final model. This processing based on earthquakes with mb≥4 and the error RMS is 0.01-0.26 sec. Compressional wave velocity of the crust is 6.23±0.07 km/s and the upper mantel (Moho) is 8.08±0.08 km/s. since, shear waves velocity for the crust, found to be 3.64±0.06 km/s and the upper mantel (Moho) is 4.70±0.01 km/s. Depths for Conrad and Moho discontinuities were obtained 11±2 km and 43±3 km respectively, which well correlate with the results of the previous gravimetric crustal studies},

abstract ={(Paper pages 591-614) The Zydoun plain experiences semi-arid climatic conditionو and though groundwater quality is not commonly acceptable with respect to drinking, it is used for irrigation. The water withdrawal of water and its increasing trend would probably put the study area into critical condition to meet demand. The main sources of water supply in the region are Zydoun aquifer and Zoreh River. The better quality of groundwater in the extreme southern part of the plain and lower exploitation expenses are the reasons why farmers prefer to use groundwater rather than river water. As a result of over- exploitation from the Zydoun aquifer in the last years water table has been declined. In order to impede critical situation in the area, a detailed study regarding management of groundwater including physiography, meteoro-logy, hydrology, hydrogeology, hydrochemistry and geomor-phology were undertaken. Based on these investigations, a number of ephemeral streams in the southern part of the plain were recognized to be suitable in term of water quantity and quality to secure a part of water demand of the area. One of the optimum methods for long-term use of these water resources is injection of water into ground and withdrawal in required time. to this end, the collected data, were put together and it was found that the most suitable method of artificial recharge was channel modification. At the end, considering consideration, morphological, permeability condition and water demands in the southern part of the Zydoun plain, eleven sites for execution of water resources management were suggested which would annually augment aquifer storage by over one MCM.},

abstract ={In this study, seepage phenomena through the left abutment of Marun dam are investigated. The Marun dam is a 170 m high rock fill dam, which regulates the waters of the Marun River, serves power generation, and flood control and provides irrigation needs. The dam site lies in the Zagros Mountains of southwest Iran. This region presents continuous series of mainly karstic limestone, marl, shale and gypsum ranging in age from Cretaceous to Pliocene. The region has subsequently been folded and faulted. All underground excavations are sited in the left abutment. The spacing of the diversion tunnels and pressure tunnel is considered to be acceptable, meaning relatively short, thus requiring 2 row grouting curtain into both embankments. Prior the reservoir impoundment, the concrete plug was constructed into the middle section of second diversion tunnel. Upstream section of tunnel was not concreted. During the first reservoir impounding, the old karst channels along ‘Vuggy Zone’ cut by the second diversion tunnel were reactivated and leakage occurred. The total amount of water leakage through the left bank of Marun dam was about. The unlined second diversion tunnel had a key role in connecting reservoir with karst conduit system. On the basis of detailed engineering geological analysis, the concept of remedial works was carried out. The main points of this concept are one of row grout curtain extension up to the section with shaly interbeds declared as watertight Asmari sequence (close to the watertight Pabdeh formation) and plugging of accessible section of main karst channel by concrete. In order to determine the seepage direction and karstification pattern, solubility studies were done. Also pinhole, XRD and XRF tests were carried out. The major joint system and interbedding cracks have predominant role in karst evolution process. Hydrogeological role of joints, perpendicu-lar to geological structure, is not negligible. As a result of these studies, seepage paths have been identified in the karstic limestone in the left abutment of the dam.},

Also in the paper, the feasibility of developing and using artificial neural networks (ANNS) for slope stability prediction is investigated. According to the geometry of slopes and strength and deformation properties of alluviums, factor of safety is calculated in 2D and 3D by PLAXIS7.2 and PLAXIS 3D Tunnel codes, respectively, and the results are also compared. In addition, stability of slopes is investigated through the use of MLP artificial neural networks (ANNs), which developed in MATLAB environment. The database used for development of the model comprises a series of 252 factor of safety for different slopes conditions (2D, 3D, flatted and 18 inclined from horizon at top of cut). The optimal ANN architecture (hidden nodes, transfer functions and training) is obtained by a trial-and-error approach in accordance to error indexes and real data. The input data for slope stability estimation consist of values of geotechnical and geometrical input parameters. As an output, the network estimates the factor of safety (FoS). The results indicate that the ANN model is able to accurately predict the FoS of the slopes.},

Liners of these landfills are of great import-anttce as they play a crucial role in minimizing pollutant migration and therefore preventing ground water contamination. Liners may consist of a locally available soil and bentonite mixtures. In this study effect of NaCl and MgCl2 solutions of various concentrations has been investigated.The mixtures were prepared with a local clay specimen from Varamin and a proportion of bentonite content of 10 % and 20 % of total dry weight. Laboratory tests including 1D consolidation for determining permeability and compressibility of the soil mixtures, liquid limit and free swell tests were carried out. Results indicated that both solution type and its concentration affect the properties of the mixtures. Comparison of hydraulic conductivity of different salt solutions shows that the divalent cations have more effect than monovalent cations. Comparison of different salt concentrations for a particular salt on a particular soil mixture shows that the hydraulic conductivity decreases with decreasing salt concentration. This decrease can be attributed to an increase in diffuse double layer thickness.},

Using recorded accelerograms in the gallery station as the input motion and also using different masses for foundation, 2D numerical analysis are performed and the dam-foundation interaction problem is studied. Recorded and calculated responses of dam body are compared with each other based on different approaches. It should be mentioned that the used earthquake records in this research are weak and linear behavior for dam body is assumed. The obtained results show that time-frequency distribution (TFD) is an appropriate method to process the recorded and calculated signals and also using below 50 per cent (20-30 per cent) for the mass of foundation is can lead to the nearest results to recorded responses.},

Experimental study of behavior of this type of material is usually difficult due to problems associated with use of large testing apparatus or large specimens. Several researchers have proposed methods for the test of these materials by removing larger fraction of them and testing finer matrix. In this research, a regular set of large direct shear tests with a 300*300*160 mm shear box performed to determine shear strength and dilation characteristics of sand-gravel mixtures in high gravel contents. Bad graded fine sand was used besides uniform gravel grains with maximum grain size of 12.5 mm as testing materials. The tests conducted on mixtures prepared in four gravel contents of 70, 80, 90 and 100 percents. Samples constructed in three relative densities of 35, 60 and 85% and tested by different surcharge pressures of 100, 200 and 300 kPa. Experiments conducted on completely dry samples in consolidated drained condition. Shear strength behavior of mixtures was investigated and it was concluded that both shear strength and friction angle increases with gravel content, relative density and surcharge pressure. However, dilation increases by increase in gravel content and relative density and reduces with increase in surcharge pressure. Results were compared with previous experiments on mixtures with less gravel contents and it was observed that in little gravel contents the behavior is controlled by the both sandy matrix and gravel grains. However, as gravel content increases from floating limit, the behavior is mainly controlled by gravelly part of mixture and sand fraction has little effects on its behavior.},

The grains, which are remained in the borehole, mixed with slurry (cement) and create an improved mass of soil. This mass is named “Soilcrete”. Soilcrete mass has special characteristics such as high strength, low deformability and very low permeability. In this paper, principles governing to jet grouting and effective parameters have been explained. Then the test results obtained from Soilcrete column have been analyzed and discussed. Based on the results, jet grouting has led to increase and improvement of physical and mechanical characteristics of soils, i.e. uniaxial compressive strength, cohesion and internal friction angle. Finally the values of jet grouting parameters are recommended in order to achieve larger diameters in the mentioned site based on trial grouting results},
