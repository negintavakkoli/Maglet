Having a safe, secure and comfortable shelter is one of the long-term desires of every human being, but this need is also related to other human needs. On the other hand, today this reality is added to other realities that every phenomenon at any moment is a manifestation of the constant analysis and combination of variables that have regular, continuous, and multiplicative correlations; therefore, in investigating the phenomenon of housing, what is important is the relation and influence of its various aspects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regional indexes affecting housing in Ilam province using TOPSIS technique. The research method is descriptive-analytical and development-applied, and GIS, GRAFER and EXCEL software have been used. The results of the study showed that the density index in the residential unit in the Ilam province between 1996 and 2006, except in 1997 and 1998, has slightly increased, the trend has improved since 1999and has approached the ideal. The average number of households in the residential unit showed that the construction of residential units in the province had been increasing but could not fully compensate for housing shortages. In contrast, the average household in the residential unit in the province had an upward trend. Finally, the TOPSIS model showed that CL was the highest and lowest in the following areas Ilam (0.99), Dehloran (0.13), Ivan (0.09), Mehran (0.08), Abdanan (0.05), Darreshahr (0.04) and Shirvan (0.00).</field></doc></add>
