				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Saffron is the most expensive agricultural product in the world and Iran is the largest saffron producer in the world. Saffron contamination in different stages of the production process, in addition to quality loss leads to reducing credit in the global market and exporting. Therefore, it is necessary to select an appropriate method for inactivation the microbial flora of saffron. Among the common methods that used to inactivation the microorganisms, cold plasma is due to the potential benefits such as non-toxic nature, low operational costs, and a significant reduction in water consumption during decontamination, and the possibility of its use for a variety of food products has attracted much attention. Plasma is a state of ionizing gas, including ions, electrons, ultraviolet rays, and reactive species such as radicals, atoms and molecules that can ignite, which can inactivate microorganisms. in this research, cold plasma was produced using two types of gas including nitrogen and air, and the effect of plasma radiation at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 minutes on the chemical and microbial (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Mold and Yeast) properties of saffron were investigated. The results of this study showed that germicidal effect of nitrogen plasma was lower than air plasma and the plasma exposure time had a significant effect on reduction of microbial load and by increasing the time of plasma exposure, the inactivation of microorganisms increased. The maximum microbial reduction was observed in 12 minutes. Maximum reduction in microbial load was observed at 12 minutes and 18 kilovolt voltage, which reduced the population of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, mold and yeast by 2/69, 2/48, 1/95 log cycle respectively, However, with increasing radiation time, the amount of crocin, picocrocin and safranal decreased (pË‚0.05). Reduction of crocin, safranal and picocrocin in 12 minutes was 6/01, 4/04, 5/44%, respectively.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In order to investigate the impact bio fertilizer novafol and mother corm weight on leaves growth, chlorophyll content and flower and stigma yields of saffron (Crocus sativus L.), an experiment was done as randomized complete block design with three replications in the Agricultural Research Station, University of Birjand, during the growth season of 2016-17. Experimental factors were amino acid application (Novafol, containing 28% amino-acid. Applied as corm soaking + fertigation in three levels: 0, 2 and 4 L.ha-1) and mother corm weight (0.1-4, 4.1-8 and 8.1-12 g). The effect of bio-fertilizer novafol was significant on the flower number, flower yield, dry stigma yield and chlorophyll a content. The highest flower number (16.5 per m-2), flower yield (5.63 g m-2), dry stigma yield (0.108 g m-2) and chlorophyll a content (1.09 mg. g-1 FW) were obtained from 4 L.ha-1, while, the lowest flower number (14.22 per m-2), flower yield (4.55 g m-2), stigma yield (0.085 g. m-2) and chlorophyll a (0.97 mg. g-1 FW) were gained in control treatment, but, there was no significant difference between two levels (2 and 4 L.ha-1) novafol bio fertilizer. Corm weights aslo significantly affected all studied traits. The highest stigma length (25.1 mm), flower yield (10.4 g m2), leaf length (31.42 cm) and fresh and dry weight of leaves (0.29 and 0.083 g per plant, respectively) were obtained from big corms, but the lowest of them were obtained from small ones. Interaction effect of corm weight and novafol bio fertilizer was significant on chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll contents and number of leaves per plant. The highest chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll (1.77 and 2.95 mg. g-1 FW, respectively) and number of leaves (7.58 per plant) were obtained from 4 L.ha-1 of novafol bio fertilizer and big corm. Overall, application of novafol bio fertilizer (4 L.ha-1) improved the vegetative and reproductive growth parameters. Big corms planting also had an important role in increasing the growth and yield of saffron.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is a sterile triploid geophyte plant that is propagated by corms. Considering the crucial role of the mother corms quality in saffron production, a program for "STANDARDIZATION OF SAFFRON CORMS" should be developed in Iran, a measure that has not been taken up yet. There are several obstacles that stop us from having this comprehensive program, for example the lack of standard fields to produce high quality corms, the lack of a clear and precise criteria for sorting produced mother corms, the lack of supervision or poor supervision provided by authorized organizations on production and presentation of high quality corms and unbalanced supply and demand ratio in saffron corms markets, are considered as the most important reasons. Moreover, mixing the healthy and infected corms as well as the storage of corms, regardless of optimal temperature conditions or environmental hygiene, are considered as other challenges in the production and processing cycle of saffron. In this review, some obstacles and prerequisites for implementation of a comprehensive program for STANDARDIZATION OF SAFFRON CORMS are discussed. Further, useful approches and techniques for producing standard corms such as the establishment of managed fields, quality criteria for sorting harvested corms, and the principle storage of corms are outlined. In addition, some effective strategies for the implementation of this program, including the provision of training courses, comperhensive monitoring on the services and functioning in the supply and demand market of saffron corms, helping to meet the needs and demands of consumers, editing incentive plans and supportive programs to saffron producers are specifically provided.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study was conducted to investigate the identification and heterologous expression of Saffron stigmas Glycosyl transferase coding isoform gene during the pollination stage. The results have been obtained by sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of an isolated gene from saffron genomes by degenerate oligoâ€™s revealed that the gene is in1283 bp length and belongs to CsUGT protein family which has Apo- plastic secretion in the cell. to evaluate the enzymatic function, firstly the isolated sequence was sub-cloned under arabinose induce promoter in pThio-UGT expression vector by Gibson assembly technique, then the recombinant vector transformed into BL21-pGro7 bacteria which were able to express chaperon proteins with EL&amp; ES subunits. Followed by destructing the bacteria cell wall via ultrasound, the pellet was suspended by PBS solution and then the soluble proteins were extracted by boiling method. Finally, the protein electrophoresis by SDS pages10% was showed that the recombinant protein of CsUGT expressed correctly in bacteria with 69/5 kDa molecular weight. The gained results in this project could be applied to determine the breeding's strategies to improve qualitative and quantitative traits such as color and aroma in saffron.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The ecological footprint (EF) is a strong indicator of sustainability analysis that is used today in scientific communities. The footprint index determines the space required to support an activity by the average area needed to provide resources and absorb waste in term of global hectare (ghaGha). In this study, due to the significant increase in saffron production in recent years, the sustainability of saffron production in southern Khorasan province as one of the most important saffron production centers in the country was investigated. The data for this research was collected through questionnaires and interviews with the 396 farmers in 2017. According to the different yield and consumption of inputs in different years, sustainability investigation was carried out for the first to sixth years. For this purpose, the amount of bioproductve land directly required for the production of the saffron was considered as an indicator of the direct ecological footprint and the amount of bioproductve land needed to absorb the waste generated by the production process as indirect ecological footprint. The results of this study showed that the average indirect EF of saffron was 2.02 global hectare (ghaGha), which 0.07 was related to on farm and 0.13 gha Gha was related to off farm emission. The highest EF was allocated to the first year of production. The multi-functional ecological footprint showed that the EF land was 0.01 gha, EF revenue 0.63 gha Gha and EF yield was 0.003 ghaGha. Comparing the results of this study with the results of other agricultural sector studies conducted in Iran and elsewhere in the world showed thatGeneraly it seems that saffron production is relatively sustainable farming compared to other agricultural productscrops.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study is a comprehensive research in water resource management using water footprint approach, water footprint accounting and water use efficiency by clustering analysis. In this study, water footprint of green, blue and gery in saffron production are calcuated using principle framework during 2008-2014 . Based on, these indicators calculated using data and common methodology. Result shown, the share of WFGreen, WFBlue and WFGrey is 20, 90 and 10% respectively in the saffron production that mean of water footprint estimated 2764 m3/kg. Amount of water footprint accounting and water use efficiency calculated 1.91-5.93 m3/kg and 0.2-0.62 kg/m3, respectively. In assessing the prioritizing of the provinces by two indicators, the provinces were divided into four categories. Lorestan, Kermanshah, Hamedan, North Khorasan, Tehran, Kerman, East Azerbaijan and Zanjan provinces including the lowest water footprint accounting and water footprint while these provinces have the highest water use efficiency. The category of these provinces is the first rank. Golestan, Ghazvin, Markazi, Alborz, Yazd, South Khorasan and Razavi Khorasan provinces are the second rank, Fars and Semnan are the third rand and Chaharmahal and Bakhtirai is the end rank of priority. Based on results, considering indicators such as water use efficiency, water footprints and footprint counting can help decision makers to development cultivation of Saffron.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Upon arrival of the saffron to the laboratory's qualitative process, an initial assessment is carried out by an expert on the basis of the apparent features. However, human error in determining the quality of saffron based on its apparent features is inevitable; use of artificial intelligence techniques can be effective in reducing human errors while mechanizing the system. It was a diagnostic study and its database consisted of 113 samples of saffron with 7 features, which were collected by the researchers on October 2016 from the valid laboratory of Saffron and under the supervision of an expert. Sample qualitative analysis was performed with the help of features in 4 different classes including excellent, good, average and second grade average. Artificial neural networks have been used to classify saffron. After analyzing and comparing the generated models using multilayer perceptron neural networks and learning vector neural network, the highest accuracy of classification on the training and testing samples was obtained with 75.93 and 75.75%, respectively. The accuracy obtained indicated that the multi-layer perceptron neural network model can be used as a decision maker by an expert or independently in saffron lab centers.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Developing countries try to attend in trade agreements to achieve safer target markets and reduce trade barriers. Iran also is in trade agreements such as economic cooperation organization (ECO) and global system of trade preferences (GSTP). While there is generally believed that presence in trade agreements generally has positive effect on countries trade flows, there is no any guarantee for positive effect on all countries and products. So, due to the importance of saffron exports for Iran, the aim of this paper is to answer the question of whether Iranâ€™s membership in trade agreements has led to increase the saffron exports to member importing countries. For the purpose, gravity model and saffron exports data in the period of 2001-2014 are used. The results showed that income and population of saffron importers has positive and significant effects, while geographical distance and economic crisis has negative and significant effects on saffron exports. Based on the results, Iranâ€™s membership in trade agreements has significantly negative effect (-3.475) on Iranâ€™s saffron exports. In other words, membership in trade agreements cannot lead to increase Iranâ€™s saffron exports to member trading countries in agreements. Therefore, it is suggested that exporting companies of saffron use the opportunities provided by participating in these trade agreements to take appropriate marketing policies and strategies in order to increase Iran's saffron exports to member trading partners in the agreement.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Data were collected by completing 380 questionnaires from saffron farmers in Torbat-e Heydarieh in 2018. The descriptive results of the study showed that most saffron farmers believe in increasing temperature, reducing rainfall and the emergence of drought and frostbite. Reducing water supply, reducing yields of saffron, reducing economic efficiency, unemployment and migration are among the consequences of climate change in Torbat-e Heydarieh. Also, based on the results, 63% of saffron farmers are willing to use adaptation strategies. The results of the Logit model estimation show that the variables of agricultural experience, land size, access to credit, extention services, media exposure and education affect the likelihood of choosing adaptive strategies. However, the variables of mechanization level and side occupation did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of choosing compatibility strategies. Therefore, government policies should provide the bank with confidence in providing bank facilities to saffron farmers who provide saffron farmers with the ability and flexibility to manage water resources, soil and other inputs in response to climate change.]]></dcterms:abstract>
