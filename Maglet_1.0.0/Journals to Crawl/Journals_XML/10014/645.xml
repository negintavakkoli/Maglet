The continuous changes, shows the importance of theoretical and practical readiness in relation to environmental issues. Two topics that have got attention of both academics and practitioners are &#8220;Business Network&#8221; and &#8220;Business Ecosystem&#8221;. This paper tries to scrutinize the concepts in order to delimitate them and considers outcomes of moving to and shaping business ecosystem. Therefore, Science direct, Emerald Insight and Google Scholar documents in period of 2000 to 2019 is extracted. 54 Documents are identified. In order to analyze, main concepts are extracted and verified by panel of experts. Coding is the method of analysis. Finally, findings are categorized in structural, mental and relative dimensions. Two concepts have many similarities in terms of structural and mental dimensions but from relative point of view there are significant differences. One of the most important outcomes of shaping business ecosystem is the change of innovation model from conservative and imitative to absorptive innovation.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>In today's age where knowledge is a driving force at regional and country level, the role of entrepreneurial ecosystems that foster the innovative and knowledge based entrepreneurial activities is very crucial in terms of competitiveness of resource attraction and wealth creation. Now the question arises: what is the model of regional competitiveness based on the knowledge entrepreneurship ecosystem structure? In order to answer this question, the present study was conducted with the purpose of application, qualitative approach and method of grounded theory. In this regard, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 theoretical and practical informants in the field of regional policy and entrepreneurship who were selected based on snowball pattern. Among the categories cited, &#34;changing the mindset of stakeholders to the efficiency of knowledge-based entrepreneurship capabilities&#34; was identified as the focal category that would be expected if the strategies were implemented in the shadow of environmental and the mediator conditions.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>The focus of this research, due to the importance of human resource risks issues, has been on providing an analytical qualitative model to optimize the human resource risk management.&#160; In order to carry out the project, twenty samples were selected among faculty members and top managers in related fields. Fuzzy Delphi and interpretive structural modeling were used to analyze the data. The findings were led to an integrated model of human resource risks with four levels. Contextual risks as the foundation level and the most influential one and the behavioral risks as the most influenced level of the proposed model were identified. Managers were expected, in order to minimize human resource risks, to be more responsive to the levels of the model.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>This study aimed to identify the cognitive differences between expert and novice managers in the performance of their main tasks by examining their perspectives and experiences. To do so, two four-people groups of experts and novice managers, from two subsidiaries of National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company were selected. A task analysis interview was conducted for every participant and the data was encoded by Crandall, Klein, and Hoffman&#8217;s (2006) guideline and the two groups were compared together. The results revealed various cognitive differences between the two groups. Most importantly, expert managers considered probabilities, obtained the approval of others for their decisions, and paid attention to the importance of workforce. These cognitive differences can help organizations hire qualified managers, identify weaknesses in the performance of managers, and train managers.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>The purpose of this research was to design a native model of intellectual capital measurement with a pathological approach at the Ministry of Petroleum. By reviewing related literature as well as expert interviews and theme analysis, key dimensions and components of intellectual capital at the Ministry of Petroleum identified, and it has been proposed an initial model by rational communication between these dimensions and components. This model was shaped through opinions of 40 experts, collected by a questionnaire. Main factors identified through interviewing by 18 experts. Validation of proposed model was approved by experts. According to this model, the intellectual capital of the Ministry of Petroleum of Iran was consisted of three parts including: human, structural and social capital which consists of 8 dimensions and 22 components. The proposed model can be used as a basis for measuring intellectual capital in the Ministry of Petroleum.</Abstract>

The mixed method (qualitative-quantitative) was selected as the research method. The statistical population in the qualitative section consisted of managers and supervisors and the research data was gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 individuals. The data were analyzed using the grounded theory method and 185 primitive codes, 53 concepts and 18 categories were extracted. The statistical population in the quantitative section consisted of all employees and sampling method was stratification. According to the variance as the dispersion criterion, the sample size estimated 209. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire and the validity and reliability of the questionnaire were confirmed by partial least squares method.

	<Abstract>Today, the pathology of employee training is one of the most important challenges for organizations to plan more accurately and benefit from training patterns and methods. Therefore, due to the importance of human resources improvement and effective management, a model tailored to the company's native features is needed. The main purpose of this study was to determine the pathology of training the staff of National oil Products Distribution Company using the Grounded Theory&#160; method. The information was gathered through a semi-structured interview with 24 of the company's experts and review of 40 new articles. By selective and axial coding, the components of the final model and how they relate to each other were obtained. The results of the study included extraction of 31 main components and 119 sub-categories in three dimensions of process, structure and context in the paradigm of causal, axial, confounding, actions and tendencies, contexts and outcomes.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</Abstract>
