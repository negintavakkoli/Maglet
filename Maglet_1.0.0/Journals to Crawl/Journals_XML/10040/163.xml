				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Living single in Iran has an increasing trend. Single life experiences for women can bring lots of hazards. The objective of this research is to address the relationship between religious believes and high risk behavior among Yazd women. In the current study, we have used theories of social pressure and social deterrence. The theoretical framework of the present research is Emile Durkheim's theory of social solidarity. This is descriptive-analytic study that has been examined by a standardized questionnaire as the instrument. The population of the research include single women aged 18 and above in Yazd province. Using Cochran formula, the sample size was calculated 385 people. We have used multi-stage cluster sampling. Different areas of the city were divided into three parts (north, center, and south), and two blocks from each part was selected as the sample. In order to analyze the data, we have also applied SPSS 16. The results have indicated that tendency toward high risk behavior among women is at the average level. Furthermore, the religious ties of the women are at the average level. There is a reverse and significant relationship between religiosity and high risk behavior (-0.619). The high risk behavior declines as religiosity increases (p=0.000). Also, there is a significant relationship between religiosity (24.126) and marital status (p=0.000). The religiosity of married people is more than that of single people (p=0.000). The analysis of regression indicated that religious attitude affects high risk behaviors with beta coefficient of -0.558. Despite wide social changes, the results of this study confirmed that religion still controls high risk behaviors.  ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Single life, increased age of marriage, a huge number of single girls over 30 years old, high number of single educated people and the public discourse marriage have convinced the scholars to consider these as social issue. The purpose of this study is to address the meaning and causes of delayed marriage among girls. We have used qualitative methodology and grounded theory strategy. The interviewees have been selected in a targeted manner and 33 female students were studied for more than one year. Up to 15 major categories and a core category were extracted from data coding. Education and reflexivity of individualistic opportunitiess continued education are some obstacles for that. The most important factors are including experience of having relationship, negative memories, and fear of divorce, job restrictions, and reliability. Some important factors of the delayed marriage are including irresponsibility, very difficult culture, and financial independence of women, modern romantic relationships, western lifestyle, and obsessive-compulsive aging. The concept of “Single experience, meaningful delay” was selected as the final category. A paradigm was extracted from the data at the end of the model. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Maturity is one of the most important stages of human development, and its developmental characteristics can cause various kinds of deviations and disorders. Girls, due to their experiences of physical and mental changes, enter the stage of physical and sexual maturity earlier than boys. Their problems in the health, psychological and social dimensions are more than boys due to physiological differences, social roles and governing traditions in society. Because no research has been conducted to identify and disclose the diverse behaviors of adolescent girls, this present study is to analyze the deviant sexual behaviors of matured girls by inductive qualitative method. This research was carried out using theoretical sampling method. Up to 17 girls aged from 12 to 15 years old were purposefully sampled for the aim. In this research, the technique used for data collection was semi-structured and deep interviewing, and the grounded method (systematic: Strauss &amp; Corbin) was used for data analysis. The analysis ultimately addresses 9 main categories including technology-driven sexual activity, risky leisure, passive self-stimulation, emotional disturbances, poorly-sustained parenting-and-addiction, lack of good sexual education, lack of self-regulation motivational skills, religious environments and environmental stimuli, incitement and the core of abnormal sexual socialization.   ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Marriage for the second time will be a big challenge if any of the man or woman or both have children. In this case, there will be challenging factors including various cultural, economic, traditions and beliefs and many other problems. Even the existence of a child will be one of the main reasons for preventing them from marriage. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the experience of the challenges of re-marriage with the presence of children and to identify its final structure in the participants who had experienced that. In this research, a qualitative descriptive phenomenological research has been directed to collect and evaluate information about the challenges of re-marriage with the presence of the children. Fourteen subjects who experienced remarriage in their married life were selected through targeted sampling and data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis has revealed 4 main themes (themes) and 10 sub-themes (categories). These are including: "Perceiving the problems of having a child" with categories of, behavioral problems and children's adaptation, the presence of the child as an obstacle, the acceptance or rejection of the child of the remarriage; economic and financial dimension with the categories of the importance of economic dimension and the necessity of financial management; social and cultural dimensions with categories of social and cultural inefficiencies, interference of those around them, social facilitation or inhibition; and requirements for re-marriage with the categories of facilitators and importance of proper behaviors and understanding of the spouse. The results of this research have indicated that this is a multidimensional phenomenon with individual, economic, social, cultural and family dimensions. The findings of this study expanded the limited literature on the experience of re-marriage with the presence of the child. Also, the structure of the challenges posed by this study in the field of paternity treatment and premarital counseling has many implications for preventing marital dissatisfaction and increasing marital and family success. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[One of the most important issues in social service patterns, as the central place in status of gender in the welfare state, is the situation of women in the labor market, and in particular is the policy of childcare for working mothers. This is problematic topic in various aspects of the family and society and, therefore, is the basis for creating wide disagreements in the views, positions and policy strategies. One of the most important ways of understanding the deficiencies and strategies for improving childcare policies is to study the experiences of working mothers of these policies. They are the most relevant group with these policies. This research is based on the phenomenological method and the data have been collected from a sample of mothers working with children under the age of seven. They have been selected based on purposeful sampling to focusing on employees in the universities of Isfahan. The intention is to understand the meaning and experience of the mothers working on Iran's policies in childcare. Therefore, these data can show policy strategies to improve policy making in this sphere. The data analysis based on the seven-level approach delivered five main themes including policy evaluation, intermediate variables, effects and outcomes, and strategies. According to the results of this study, the analysis of working mothers experiences show the childcare policies in Iran from different aspects particularly lack of flexibility in the rules and their implementation in relation to maternal/child conditions and also lack of gender and advocacy in the intellectual domain of the executives and employers. This is not sufficient to provide the peace of working mothers. The results have indicated that various mediating variables such as family circumstances, financial status, work, personality, and awareness of mothers on how they perceive and deal with child care policies have an influence on the different effects of maternal/child/occupational status.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[It is generally accepted that women and girls are more vulnerable to the exploitation, poverty, violence and malnutrition than men. They have less opportunity for education and training. Social entrepreneurship gives women the opportunity to control their own destinies. It allows women enjoy greater independency, empowerment and social participation than the traditional and state-owned investments. The present study aimed to provide a social entrepreneurship model with an approach to empowerment of female household heads in the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation and identification and explanation of effective factors in the formation of this process and its consequences through applying a qualitative research method and the Grounded Theory (GT) strategy. In this regard, interviews were conducted with eighteen university experts and family workers from Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation in Fars province as the statistical sample using a semi-structured theoretical and purposive method. The interview results were analyzed in three stages namely the open, axial and selective coding. According to obtained results, empowering policies create the social entrepreneurship and the phenomenon orientation in the interaction with other factors. Relationships of these factors are shown in the final model of research. Capacity-building, physical-psychological boosting and supportive laws have significant effects on the creation of empowering policies. This attitude ultimately becomes a basis for the emergence of social entrepreneurship phenomenon.]]></dcterms:abstract>
