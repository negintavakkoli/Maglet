The question of the mission architecture and the human relationship with the artist or the audience, without addressing the question of how knowledge is possible. Knowledge of art always has discussed various thinkers. When architecture is placed below art, recognition of its scientific, engineering and artistic aspects is questioned due to its nature. As a human phenomenon, architecture is a product of human awareness of various aspects such as scientific, engineering, and artistic aspects.

That is appearance and revealing secondly, combined with moving  shodows to show the time and movement, harmony and rhythm perception. Reinforced by the imagination of the masses geometric layout occurs. Thus the spase with the help of geometry can be directed and appeared. In such as space, the human who knows where. This means that architectural thought and imagination by opening communication between the audience and the architect, and create a new world of thinking. Architect indices have sensory perception of the three worlds, imaginary and intellectual world of architecture for the audience to feel, experience and understanding of it. The audience is given the ability to self-discovery and knowledge components in contact with the imagination and create your own world. Therefore, in this study architecture not as a place of shelter and comfort, but also as a link man and the world is introduced. Architecture is what human ability to connect with reality and being a single resides upgrade to discuss the artist and the audience. The studies included in this study was carried out contrary to modern researchers that humans efficient cause, the cause of building material, building form and building formal cause as shelter and the comfort to know the ultimate cause, the efficient cause of creative imagination, because formal place, due to the mass of material and space and create an atmosphere of ultimate cause of thought and imagination has been introduced.

In recent decades especially in developing countries, rapid population growth especially followed by rapid constructions, exclusive of urban scale aesthetics criterions in meeting the needs of the excessive population, has made the urban scape facing serious challenges and has turned urban scape, a controversial subject in urban design studies. In day light, people moving across the public realm of the city are able to observe all the corners and details. On the other hand by starting darkness during every night, at which the majority of people tend to spend some quality time for leisure across urban spaces, urban night scape has made the unpleasant views, which were visible during daylight, disappear by emphasizing the aesthetics standards and bring a different face to people sights than it used to be during day time. At this time, criterions of the aesthetics component as one of night scape components, could fulfill the sense of pleasance for people having nocturnal strolls. Therefore in this paper, urban night scape is defined through the &amp;lsquoLight&amp;rsquo at the heart of darkness in the night as the first layer of human touch with the urban form. Components such as built and natural components and human and their activities as the premium factors for sense of place have been introduced as the main urban scape constituents. Following what we mentioned above, due to great variety in defining Aesthetics topics, it is being considered as one of the qualitative component of the night scape and its role in human perception process is explained. We also discuss the expectations from night scape regarding aesthetics components and its relation with lighting. In the following, light color is defined as one of the qualitative issues affecting the aesthetics messages of night scape and it is introduced as a robust quantity in the urban night scape layer. Then each of urban scape elements is described according to aesthetics night scape. In this context, at the beginning of the debate, built elements of urban scape layer are expressed and we briefly discussed the role of urban facades during night scape as the most important built issue in urban space structures and spatial sequences and it is followed by other built components based in our space. Lighting accents on architectural achievements are described in this topic, and also the concept of Gestalt Reversal and changes occurred in urban facades which are derived from changes in modern architecture contemplation, during the night scape are defined. Night scape natural factors are described as the natural identical and shaping factors of urbanscape as well as role of water, green masses, topographies, hills and valleys are expressed in aesthetics night scape. Eventually man and his activities as a sense of response to pleasure from behavior settings, observing activities and social interactions during night scape layer are described. In the end we concluded the main objectives of the aesthetics night scape of the city and also the role of each of the components of urban scape was collected in a table.

The advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are designed to be efficient in many aspects such as helping users in making travel route choice decisions, alleviating road congestion and enhancing network performance. These systems can propose a variety of information to users due to their criteria and objectives. In this paper, to enhance the performance of the network, it is assumed that all of the vehicles in Tehran network are equipped with ATIS and the information of system optimal (SO) routs is proposed to the users. travel times of some suggested paths are more than those of the shortest paths of the network, simply a portion of the users follows the information while the other uses the shortest paths. Accordingly, users are divided into two groups, and assigned to the network based on system optimal and user equilibrium, respectively. An iterative method is presented for assigning the demand of both groups simultaneously based on extending the well-known Frank-Wolf algorithm. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of total travel time and average travel speed is performed regarding the different percentages of using the information of routes.

Parliament Square as one of the oldest squares in Tehran in the vicinity of many historical and cultural monuments. It is the most valuable town squares. The area of tissue erosion, environmental pollution, reduce the incidence of injuries social belonging and the opportunity to eliminate the threats to replace it. Therefore it is necessary to fix these problems, &quot;the design quality of the Parliament&quot; pedestrian-oriented development and urban furniture changes implemented. Similar experience with a focus on implementation projects improve the quality of road shows that some of these projects, however, with the aim of improving the quality of life of the inhabitants of the city administration, but ultimately the sustainability of urban development not helped. The study &quot;is whether the quality of the Parliament on various aspects of design can lead to sustainable urban development&quot; theory-based research theoretical framework of urban development in four dimensions: social, cultural, environmental and economic impacts were developed. This study combined quantitative and qualitative data through interviews and questionnaires have been collected. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Check the quality of the design hypothesis suggests that Parliament should fully implement and comply with the other projects the city center can lead to the sustainable urban development.

Historical context of cities reflects the civil character, culture and urban interactions. In these contexts, in addition to the physical, is answered to create an atmosphere in accordance with the function and performance. Moreover, the notions of &quot;body&quot; and function are raised as effective components in interventions of historical contexts. Therefore, understandingthese components are important both towards intervening in historical contexts and towards extending its notions toother sectors,  by looking at the historical context, it is obvious that forming and  their life in historical continuity, cultural, social, environmental has beenexplicit as coherent and coordinated. Residents ofthese contextshavereceived their identitythroughsocial interactions andparticipationin creating thesepermanentatmospheres. The impact of such permanent places is in forming of individual and social and cultural identity.

One of the mechanisms for control and reducing greenhouse gas emissions adjusted is the clean development Mechanism. These mechanisms include projects that the developed countries operate to fulfill their commitments to reducing emissions and also contribute to sustainable development in developing countries and for reducing emissions are received CER (Certified Emission Reduction).In this paper, the role of implementation of CDM projects to achieve the goals of the resistance economy, Perspective Document and strategies to defeat unjust sanctions imposed on the country has been studied.One way of controlling and greenhouse gas management optimum use of energy from fossil fuels for reducing energy usage and consequently reduce. dissemination of pollutant gases of it. Another way isthe use of fuels with low-carbon or no-carbon (nuclear power and renewable energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, and biomass fuels).A third option that has been discussed in this article the role of CDM and environmental projects, especially carbon management by extraction or stopping carbon to reduce greenhouse gases and increasing the efficiency of energy generation from wasted energy and the combustion process. According to the International Covenant on Kyoto, signatory countries are required to implement the commitments and provide needed items of CDM and environmental projects.Therefore, mentioned projects, are not subject to sanctions imposed against Iran and since the Iran has abundant oil and gas resources and is in the area with the capabilities full of renewable energy and also the recent sanctions imposed on the country's economy is causing injuries incidence, Environmental and CDM projects can be used as a mechanism to defeat sanctions and to be used greater prosperity for resistive economic goals of Islamic Iran.
