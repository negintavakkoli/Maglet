Researches and evaluation of the different ideas on the subject of design, the complexity of this field of science and providing perspective theories in this regard lead the experts to look deeper into the subject, thus creating descriptive opinions in this regard. Taking another look at this issue will lead the designers and architects to consider a targeted effort based on the knowledge as the practice criteria in their design process, by choosing an appropriate method to achieve the ultimate goal. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on the theory of architecture and design methods. In this context, little research has also been done on sensory experiences of architectural environment which is driven from a kind of interdisciplinary approach, relying on the theory of architecture in the form of philosophical research, known as phenomenology. In order to achieve the goal of investigating the phenomenological paradigm and its impact on the design process and choosing the method of concretizing the space through design, this study has addressed the sensory perception by the phenomenological approach. Finally, investigating the effective turning points of this point of view in the chosen method of designers in the design process in the presented model is considered. This study was conducted in the form of field research and with regard to the selected sample, and the results of quantitative and qualitative data were formed and environmental qualities such as: analysis of favorable and unfavorable winds, the level of noise pollution in the environment, the effectiveness of good smell of plants and the unfavorable smell of the environment in the desired site were measured and the desired and undesired qualitative and quantitative factors of the environment were analyzed and IDW method was used to analyze them and they were integrated with each other using fuzzy logic. The results have been chosen as the standard practice in the design of Shiraz school for the Blind site.
