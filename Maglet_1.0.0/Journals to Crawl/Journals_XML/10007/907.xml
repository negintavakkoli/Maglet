	<abstract language="eng">Qajar architecture is considered as the historic season of Iranian architecture regarding the separation from the past traditions and keep pace with the achievements of the Western civilization. Qajar palaces, as the most progressive architectural works to attract the transformations of architecture in their era, played a vital role to change the values of Iranian architecture. This article investigates the tendency towards the Western architecture in palaces of Qajar Era and is looking for to evaluate the quiddity of this tendency from a critical view. The method in this research is case studies and combined strategies and the data collection has been prepared through the literature review and fieldwork. Research findings show that Qajar government did not have significant emphasis on gaining the technological and structural advances of the West and Qajar kings were limited and satisfied with superficial shifts to cover the weaknesses of their government. This approach, which rose to its peak at the late Naserid period, without having any concern for the evolution of the ancient patterns of Iranian architecture, finally weakened historical architectural traditions and caused to appearance of the completely alien and unfamiliar royal palaces in Iran.

	<abstract language="eng">Urban spaces are representations of the citizens&amp;rsquo; life quality based on the environmental, cultural and social structures. One can come to a clear and general overview on this point by analyzing those structures as parts of the whole city or society. The study of urban spaces from this point of view has been neglected due to several reasons including the easiness of understanding the physical and environmental aspects compared to the meaning and performance of the urban spaces. In other words, the humanistic and phenomenological approaches have not been applied enough in studying the quality of urban spaces. The emphasis on the mentioned approaches has led to recognize the effectiveness of the environment on the human behaviors and activities. Such effectiveness is professionally studied in the field of environmental psychology. Accordingly, this article attempts to provide a theoretical-analytical investigation on the effectiveness of environment on the human behavior emphasizing on those behaviors that are the consequent of limiting the presence of some social groups &amp;ndash;especially the women- in the urban spaces which in turn leads to a gendered urban spaces. From the methodological point of view, this study is a strategic-urban research with an applied method retrieved from the results of descriptive-inferential and library-based studies based on which our model is formed. The theoretical framework of this research is based on the ecological theory and Lang&amp;rsquo;s Positive Concept theory. Among the perception-relevant theories we have used the Probabilistic Functionalism theory of Brunswik, Gibson&amp;rsquo;s theory of Environmental Capabilities, and Berlain&amp;rsquo;s theory of environmental attractive characteristics. On the other hand, in relation to the gender-oriented urban spaces we have used Lefebvre&amp;rsquo;s theory of differential spaces. Moreover, we have referred to Moon, Rockefeller, Koskela, and Tonkiss approaches, particularly the Rapoport&amp;rsquo;s nonverbal approach. The accuracy of hypothesis has investigated by using Structural Equational Modeling (SEM) especially Partial Least Square (PLS) method in Smart PLS and SPSS software. In addition bootstrapping, Confirmatory factor analysis, Cross Validated Redundancy (CV red.), Cross Validated Communality (CV com.), t- value test, Stone-Geisser&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;Q&amp;sup2; value and GOF index have been evaluated. Comparing significant level of meaning, function and form of urban space (3.403, 2.405 and 6.085) also the relation between behavioral pattern s and gendered space (8.725) with acceptable level (1.96) shows the accuracy of hypothesis. Findings of this research show that the environment acts as a behavioral headquarter based on which there is a specific relationship between the physical aspects and behavioral patterns, manifesting the emergence of relatively similar behaviors in different times by different people. If we manage to identify the effective environmental factors on the behavior, then we would be able to plan the capabilities of the environment for forming or preventing the specific behavioral patterns. All people use the space desirably with regard to their own perceptions, needs and motivations. People add new meanings to the space and create the social space through reproduction of the spaces. Spatial and symbolic divisions are the result of the mentioned process and they can encourage or discourage the presence of some social groups like the women. Accordingly, they can affect the formation of the gender-based geography of the cities. This gendered geography is defined by the meanings and signs rather than its physical aspects.&amp;nbsp;

	<abstract language="eng">Receive moral messages, with an emphasis on personal relationships and the ethics of care can lead people value human relations and social responsibility. Their moral development, particularly ethic of care, can be physical characteristics such as caring, compassion, benevolence, kindness and responsibility to foster the sort. Dimensions moral education focused on individual moral judgment and moral and social responsibility towards the community; Because components of media literacy includes cognitive, emotional, aesthetic and moral, so the relationship between ethics and social responsibility in following ethical dimension of media literacy takes place. Because morality is considered one of the constructive aspects of social responsibility; Regardless of man and his moral action is meaningless; And human action a moral judgment about the message that one of the business environment. The main purpose of this article is to review the three components of media literacy, literacy and communication between them on the side of moral and social responsibility requirements in the context of human agency as the media is to provide a logical analysis of angles, perspective and challenges facing the concepts revealed. According to this argument no attention to the safety, health and welfare of the public good, it is the social responsibility and the ability to manage them. Keeping in mind that the concept of morality with knowledge of social responsibility, ethical literacy and media literacy as one of the sides (cognitive, emotional, aesthetic and moral) can be at par with other human needs of the twentieth century and I was supposed to live.

	<abstract language="eng">هدف اصلی برنامه&amp;shy;ریزی شهری، ارتقای کیفیت زندگی و ایجاد محیط آرام و جذاب برای شهروندان است و مبلمان شهری به عنوان یکی از مهم&amp;shy;ترین عناصر محیط شهری، سهم بسزایی در مطلوبیت و مطبوعیت فضا از نظر شهروندان دارد. از سویی استانداردسازی مبلمان شهری منجر به افزایش کارآیی این عناصر، پایداری بیشتر مبلمان شهری و ارتقای سطح رضایت کاربران می&amp;shy;گردد. عدم رعایت استانداردسازی مبلمان شهری در آشفتگی بصری و ایجاد نارضایتی برای کاربران را به همراه خواهد داشت.

در این مقاله با استفاده از نرم&amp;shy;افزارهای GIS و Spss، نسبت به جمع&amp;shy;آوری داده&amp;shy;ها از طریق پیمایش میدانی و توزیع پرسشنامه در میان کاربران مبلمان&amp;shy;ها و بررسی کمی و کیفی این عناصر، پرداخته شده است. بر اساس مطالعات انجام شده، نقاط ضعف فراوانی در برنامه ریزی این عناصر در سطح محدوده یافت می&amp;shy;شود. از جمله: عدم جانمایی صحیح عناصر مختلف مبلمان شهری، تراکم بیش از حد انواع مبلمان، آشفتگی محیطی ناشی از پراکنش نامتعادل عناصر و غیره. همچنین بررسی تطبیقی استانداردهای رایج مبلمان شهری با وضع موجود، از دیگر بخش های این پژوهش است. نتایج به دست آمده نشان می&amp;shy;دهد که بر اساس بررسی&amp;shy;های میدانی در قالب توزیع پرسشنامه، میزان رضایتمندی ساکنین از مجموعه عوامل مبلمان محدوده مورد نظر، در سطح نازلی قرار دارد.

	<abstract language="eng">Foundation for Nature and the things that are in it has been established based on specific proportions. Human and this proportion have been discovered in the distant past. Master architect to transform the concept of geometry and its innovative use of space and form in the design process easier. And minimizes erosion of the concept in the process. The result of such a process, a kind of architecture that is far from the impression of taste, in terms of regularity and symmetry is understandable. Architectural design will be in the form of geometry. And the geometric thinking up in order to reveal the architectural design process. Geometry and Proportion are part of an unbreakable architecture. One of the most interesting geometric features many historic buildings, there is the golden proportions. However, many of the monuments in our country have not been examined so far in terms of geometry. Iran has always emphasized the beauty of architecture and building dimensions Iranians have tried to operate the cosmic reflection are manifested on the ground. Geometric analysis can be revealed through traditional structures. The different proportions, such as the golden ratio widely in Iranian architecture design plans, sections, geometric patterns and architectural, structural and mechanical features have been used. The results show that the geometry and proportions are many life forms found in nature. And to elaborate employed by traditional Iranian architecture to be built in a traditional architectural style; which implies the right and engineering design methodology is correct. In addition, the use of proportions because of visual beauty in the visual arts and architecture are of particular importance. And almost all works of art have been created by some kind of fit.
