				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[ Technology is one of the main determinants of international trade. Firms try to acquire beneficial technologies through different ways. One of these ways, regarded by active firms in developing countries, is technology transfer. However, many technology transfer projects have confronted with different serious challenges toward their knowledge goals realization. This research tries to identify and explain these technology transfer challenges in Iran's important commercial contracts with a thematic analysis approach. regarding the importance of deep understanding of aforementioned  challenges and its dependence on the analyzed field, we used thematic analysis in order to analyze deep interviews of 10 industrial and scientific experts . After coding the results,  18 challenges have been classified into four main groups. The necessity of having comprehensive approach to different aspects of technology transfer and considering the special context and circumstance of Iran are some of the main results. As well, unwillingness to technology transfer due to economic, political, and project based reasons related to the factor of technology transferor factor, low absorptive capacity of Iranian firms related to technology transferee factor, lack of economic sustainability related to context factor and finally different nature of technologies related to content factor were introduced as the main challenges of technology transfer in important commercial projects in Iran. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

The aim of this study was to conceptualize and Prioritize the intelligence components in knowledge-based companies through a mixed method approach. The present study aimed to explore the mixed and the functional result. The first step in research in order to achieve the objectives, is using semi-structured content analysis and interviews with activist’s knowledge-based companies (professionals, managers and relevant officials), 95 code as intelligent concepts competitive knowledge-based mining companies and 10 components were classified according to semantic relationships. At the second step, 12 experts were selected to extract their views by theoretical sampling  through a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire then analyzed the data collected through Fuzzy Delphi technique. The results of study led to the identification of eight main components of  competitors intelligence, financial intelligence, market intelligence, technical intelligence,  management intelligence, regulatory intelligence, human intelligence and political intelligence, in order to gain competitive intelligence in the knowledge-based companies.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Open innovation relies on external knowledge sources such as customers, and Customer knowledge has been neglected in researches about Iranian Defense Industry. In addition, new product failure rate is high in defense industries. This study aims to investigate the impact of Customer Knowledge Management (CKM) on the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of New Product Development and New Product Development (NPD) performance. This is a metrical and descriptive study. Considering the literature of the study, conceptual models and the hypothesis were presented. Then, in order to evaluate the models and the hypothesis, a questionnaire was designed in order to get elite's opinions about users of defense products. Using relative categorized method, the sample members were selected among the users of new defense products. The analysis of the data through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that there is a positive and significant correlation between customer knowledge management (knowledge from, about and for customer) with performance of the new product development and critical sources factors. Also the relation between the knowledge “from and the knowledge “about” with critical Success factors was confirmed, but the knowledge “for” customers was not confirmed. The results show that applying customer management knowledge in the process of developing new defense products has a great impact on successes and performance promotion of new product.]]></dcterms:abstract>
