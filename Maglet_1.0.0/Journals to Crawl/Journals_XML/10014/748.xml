			<abstract>
			The success, growth and long-term survival of an organization depend on its ability to exploit current capabilities and simultaneously explore the new competencies. Numerous articles have been devoted to the study of organizational ambidexterity in innovation, organizational and strategic management literature. Some indicated the important role of ambidexterity in organizations' performance. Others brought up that it is not so significant, and this question is yet to be answered. So far, several literature reviews and meta-analysis have been conducted on this construct, which has been focused on limited specific aspects. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of both qualitative and quantitative studies which include all types of performance and also highlight the different conceptualization of organizational ambidexterity. Therefore, this comprehensive systematic review of 134 qualitative and quantitative studies during 1991-2016 has pursued two major goals: First identifying different conceptualizations of exploration and exploitation, and second, identifying the causes of different effects of organizational ambidexterity on performance in previous studies. The review results found 15 different conceptualizations of exploration&#8211;exploitation; and also six reasons for the different results of previous research on the impact of organizational ambidexterity on performance have been identified, including measurement of organizational ambidexterity, level of analysis, research design, implementing organizational ambidexterity, performance measurement, and organizational ambidexterity conceptualization, each with its own dimensions

			<abstract>
			The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of authentic leadership on organizational learning regarding the mediating role of organizational intelligence. The present research is considered descriptive in terms of its purpose and a survey in terms of data collection. The data gathering tools were standard questionnaires of Authentic Leadership (Valmba et al, 2006), Organizational Intelligence (Albrecht, 2001), and Diane Niefe's Organizational Learning Questionnaire (2001). The likert 5 scale has been used to measure the variables. The statistical population of this study including 400 persons was the official staff of the second refinery in South Pars Gas Company. Using the Cochran formula, 119 people were selected as the final sample of the study. In order to analyze the collected data, SPSS software and structural equation test have been used. The results showed that authentic leadership has a significant effect on organizational intelligence and learning. Also, the mediating role of organizational intelligence was confirmed by the significance of the relationships.

			Effective and efficient use of knowledge capitals is one of the the most important challenges facing modern organizations, and an attempt to create a new generation of organizations that called &#34;smart organizations&#34;, is considered as mandatory requirements of the knowledge age. The main objective of the present study was to present an organizational intelligence model in the Nar&#38;kangan gas exploitation area. The rsearch method in terms of purpose was applied and in terms of data collection was descriptive-survey. The main instrument for collecting data was a researcher-made questionnaire based on Organizational Intelligence Models Raj and Santi (2001), Matsuda (1992), Halal (2000) and Albrecht (2003) and interviewed. The statistical population of the study consisted &#160;of &#160;57 managers and supervisors familiar with the management issues and theoretical foundations of the research in the operational zone of Nar&#38;Kangan gas exploitation. Among them, 35 people who had more familiarity with the subject of this research were selected through a targeted sampling method. The research findings indicated that final model of organizational intelligence in the Nar&#38;kangan gas exploitation area includes components of the importance and use of knowledge, focusing on self-managed teams, organizational structure, focusing on information technology, organizational communication and unity and agreement in the form of structural intelligence variable, and the components of belonging and belief in employee&#8217;s progress, organizational memory, individual capabilities, social capabilities, organizational cognition, and the behavior of leaders and managers in terms of human intelligence variable.

			Although the employees are expected to contribute in organizations development by utilizing their knowledge, ideas, and comments, so often they prefer to remain silent. This research was designed to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between organizational silence and leadership style at Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). In this practical study, we gathered descriptive data by questionnaire, and utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to look at the correlations among data points. The random sampling technique has been used to gather 115 data points among the target population of 350 employees at RIPI. It has been used a combination of Leadership Style questionnaire (Bass &#38; Avilio, 2000), Personality questionnaire (L.R. Goldberg, 1993), and Organizational Silence (M. Vakola and D. Bouradas, 2005) for gathering data. Reliability and validity of data were investigated by using the cronbach's alpha test and AVE test, respectively. The results indicated that the transformational and transactional leadership style has a significant reverse relationship with the organizational silence, while the relationship between non-interventional leadership style and organizational silence was insignificant. Furthermore, the introvert personality has a significant direct relationship with organizational silence. The results showed that for the staff with introvert personality, the non-interventional leadership style amplifies their silence and vice-versa. The personality variable in transformational and transactional leadership style has a moderating effect on the leadership-silence relationship as well.

This research, in terms of purpose is considered applied and in terms of collecting information, is a descriptive-correlation research. Data were collected through a researcher-made questionnaire. The reliability of research tool was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient test (0.79) and the formal validity was confirmed by the opinion of the professors and the construct validity through fitting the model of measurement.The statistical population was 700 employees of headquarter staff of South Zagros Oil &#38; Gas Company. Using Cochran formula, 248 of them were selected as statistical sample by simple random sampling method. SPSS and Amos software were used to analyze the data. Based on the results of the structural equation analysis, all the hypotheses have been confirmed. The hypothesis based on this fact that &#34;organizational citizenship behavior has a significant effect on job performance&#34;, with the coefficient of 0.77, has shown the highest path coefficient. The second hypothesis, based on the fact that &#34;understanding social responsibility of staff has significant effect on affective commitment&#34; with the coefficient of 0.65 has shown the least path coefficient. The results showed that the employees should be socially responsible for increasing their job performance. On the other hand, the social responsibility of employees by affecting the quality of employee's work life, effective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior also make changes in job performance.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
