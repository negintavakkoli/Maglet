abstract ={Mehr housing project is one of the large-scale developmental projects which commenced with the aim of easing housing shortage of the fellow countrymen, while spending a huge amount of financial, physical, and a large number of human resources. Now, measuring the extent of the relative efficiency of this project is an appropriate index for its evaluation. Thus, in the current research, the extent of the efficiency of the cities of Sistan and Balouchestan Province with population of more than 25000 in implementing Mehr housing projects over the period of 2008-2011 was measured utilizing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Technique via output-based BCC model. The variables, used as input, were human resources and physical and financial resources, and the outputs were the number of finished buildings and the extent of employment resulting from such a project. The results indicate that Mehr housing project was efficient in such cities as Chabahar, Khash, Zahedan, and Konarak and inefficient in Iranshahr, Zabol, and Saravan.&#160;},

abstract ={Nowadays, irregular horizontal expansion of the cities is one of the nation&#8217;s major problems, having been given way to as a result of ever-increasing importance attached to the cities and their population concentration. The problems of the cities are the intertwined structural, economic, social, and environmental factors resulting from irregular horizontal expansion. However, despite difficulties, it should be reiterated that the horizontal expansion of the cities is indispensable. The current research is descriptive-analytical and has investigated and analyzed spatial-structural expansion of the city of Qazvin as well as land-use changes in it. Evaluating the process of physical expansion of the city and being aware of models of land-use changes and making use of the obtained results are important in the city&#8217;s future planning. Regarding the fact that, currently, Remote Sensing technique is the best method of monitoring environmental changes and identifying land-uses, which also enjoys the highest speed and the most accuracy, the current research has used the images of Landsat from 1986 to 2011, having been evaluated and analyzed via satellite-images processing techniques and GIS. The results indicate that the constructed area of the city of Qazvin has increased from 1645.29 Hectares in 1986 to 3428.73 Hectares in 2011. According to Holdern Model, such an increase is mainly due to population factor (%58.36) and unbalanced urban expansion factor (%41.64), which are among the important factors in land-use changes in the very city.&#160;},

abstract ={There is a significantly strong relationship between identifying the worn-out city texture and urban sustainable development thus, the current article aimed at investigation the extent of relationship between the indices of identifying the worn-out textures and those of sustainable development in the area around the holy shrine of Imam Reza (PBUH) through Canonical Correlation Analysis in order to determine the covariance of the two mentioned varied groups. To this end, via survey method and researcher-developed questionnaire, the required data were collected from such three groups as group A, i.e. the owners whose property is out of texture (n= 201), group B, i.e. those who are transferring their property (n=70), and group C, other property owners (n=170) and the collected date were statistically analyzed by means of the software Statistica 8. The results obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that there is a proper linear link between the set of canonical variables. While in groups A and B, the index of texture unsustainability (X1) with an amount equal to -0.65 and in group C, the index of impassability (X2) reduced with an amount equal to -0.96, in group A, the household economic index (Y3), in group B, technical-structural index (Y1), and in group C, economic index (Y3) increase to the amount 0.59, 0.77, and 0.87, respectively. Therefore, the results show that the indices of texture identification, both sustainability- and impassability-wise, enjoy better concordance with the increase or decrease in the indices of economic and structural-technical sustainable development, and comparing with other canonical variables, play much more role in the first Canonical Correlation Coefficient, i.e. in the quality of urban sustainable development around the holy shrine.&#160;},

abstract ={Nowadays, small cities take an important role in population distribution, identical and fair distribution of social and economic activities, reducing regional inequalities, and finally, regional equilibrium, and equality in urban-regional system. The current research aims at analyzing the role of small-sized cities in regional equilibrium of urban network of East Azerbaijan Province. The research type is applied-developmental and the population was all the cities of the province. The required data was collected from the population and housing census from 1956-2011, Iran Statistics Center, Governorship, Statistical and Census Annals, and different bureaus and organizations. Moreover, to determine the extent of systemic equilibrium of the region such quantitative models as Rank-Size, Entropy Coefficient, Primate City Index, Elasticity Coefficient, Shift Share, and Location Quotient were made use of. In 2011, East Azerbaijan Province included five small-sized cities with population of 25000-50000, constituting 0.075 population of urban network of the region. The results indicated that, upon Rank-Size model, from 1986-2011, lack of equilibrium in urban hierarchy of East Azerbaijan Province was readily observable. Besides, investigating main agricultural, industrial, and service activities in small-sized cities indicated that such cities, in service section, import their demands and the only exceptions are the cities of Sarab and Azarshahr, agriculture-wise. The cities of Ajabshir and Sardroud import all their demands in all aspects and have failed to take a proper role in regional system equilibrium. Therefore, injecting capital and facilities into small cities may be a proper solution for reducing regional inequality, population concentration, and industry in the metropolis of Tabriz and finally it can bring about relative equilibrium in the regional system of East Azerbaijan Province.&#160;},

Besides limiting factors in property development, there should be encouraging motives so that the maintenance process could be fostered. Thus, the current article, aiming at focusing on the individual benefit to help serve the social benefit, is to evaluate the passed law, numbered 28/91/2293, by Isfahan Islamic city council on exemptions for repair tax, parking-lot elimination, and VAT on function change of all historical buildings of the city of Isfahan. The current research was conducted on the historical district of Jolfa in Isfahan. The research is practical/applied, purpose-wise and among field research, method-wise. Data analysis was done upon opportunity-cost analysis and the required statistical data and documents were collected in Winter 2012. The results indicated that, by comparing maintaining opportunity-cost and the subsidy granted as a result of the passed law for the very district, for 47 percent of the historical properties, the granted subsidy is sufficient enough for opportunity-cost maintenance and for the other properties, by increasing the opportunity for land efficiency, the difference between maintaining opportunity-cost and the granted subsidy would increase hence, the current law would not be effective enough to cover the maintaining opportunity-cost.},

Concentration of pollutants emitted from public transport and industries in different districts of the city have caused the increase in polluting gases and the resultant environmental temperature increase an issue which forms Urban Heat Islands. Such conditions would jeopardize the next generations&#8217; economic profits and resources as well as social benefits, standing against the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, through field research and required studies, it would be possible to take required measures for the distribution of heat pattern in the city. The major purpose behind this research is identifying and studying pollutants and heat islands resulting from human functions in the city of Mahshahr and is preventing pollution of bio-resources via setting environmental planning and strategies. The current article aims at delineating the importance of paying attention to the issue of sustainable development in urban management. The current study makes use of field study and the research method is descriptive-inferrential. According to the collected data, the number of active industries in the city of Mahshahr exceeds 72 sections including chemical, petrochemical, metallurgical, non-metallurgical mineral, food, textile, and cellulosic industries which are significant, variety-wise. The major source of pollution in the city of Mahshahr, which taking role both in making the pollutants and in forming heat islands and temperature increase, is the industry section (75%) and the rest is from urban sources (heating systems, agriculture, transport, etc.). Thus, the more active the industries are, the more pollutants like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, sulfur monoxide, nitrogen oxide and atmospheric particulates are produced which have an undeniable role in temperature increase and the formation of heat islands in specific urban districts.&#160;},
