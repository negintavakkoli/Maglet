From the classic roof garden of the world, we can find out that roof garden has close relationship with the building. Roof garden is different with other kind landscape in the city it needed cooperation of landscape architect and architect from at the stages of design, construction, upholding and management. We should attach importance to roof garden in the construction of building.

So many contradictions have appeared. In this paper, all the contradictions were picked and dissected, and the ways to solve them were given: 1. The technique and design ways of the working team should be trained, 2. The whole process of a roof green's construction should be supervised by the government, 3.
