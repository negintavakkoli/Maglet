Despite various developments in the public sector in recent years, low productivity of government agencies has been the main concern of Iranian policy makers. Employee silence and indifference towards the fate of an organization and its programs and lack of effective understanding between employees and management is an alarm of imminent reduction in organizational performance affecting the whole society at a macro level. This research attempts to provide a model to cover different dimensions of organizational silence. Organizational silence management is an important part of organizational behavior management which directly affects organizational decision-making. Survey research method and structural equation modeling were used and data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. The sample consisted of 354 male and female employees of the headquarters of the Iranian Social Security Organization. The questionnaire was designed on the basis of existing theories and using exploratory factor analysis method in 174 items. Using confirmatory factor analysis method, the components were confirmed and the final model was determined after confirmation of the components and sub-components. The final model offers a way to understand organizational silence and helps managers and policy makers reduce this phenomenon in their organization and create the spirit of work and effort among their staff. Managers can utilize this theory to eradicate organizational silence. This theory helps organization theorists achieve testable hypotheses in more comprehensive research.

Reduction of staffs&#8217; trust prevents them sharing their experience and knowledge to solve the issues in an organization and sharing their ideas to have desirable organizational changes. Thus, this research aimed at investigating the relationship between the employees&#8217; trust in managers and organizational silence. Indeed, in this research the effect of employees&#8217; perception of managers&#8217; character that according to Mayer et al, (1995) including: &#160;ability, benevolence and integrity, were studied on defensive and acquiescence silence. To cover this aim, the selected sample included 282 employees of central branch of National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (N.I.O.P.D.C) and the required data was gathered by a questionnaire and analyzed by Structural Equations Methods.
Our study showed that increasing the trust of employees in managers reduces the organizational silence of staff. In addition, if the trust in managers increase, the defensive silence reduces, while acquiescence silence increases. According to the results, managers can improve their recognition of the silence environment in organizations which can lead to the change in behavior and increasing trust in managers resulting in not only creating positive employees' perception of managers&#8217; character but also, the willingness to share knowledge, experience and information. Finally, this can increase organizational performance.

The purpose of the present study was designing a model for turnover reduction in Iranian Oil Terminals Company (IOTC) to reduce the direct and indirect costs of turnover and to take steps to improve organizational effectiveness. This study was conducted using Delphi method. According the Delphi panel, from the 12 experts related to the subject, was asked to validate the indexes of organizational turnover over the successive rounds of Delphi. The Delphi method was completed after the third round and a favorable consensus was reached. Finally, the conceptual model was designed from Delphi of experts on indigenous indices affecting the reduction of organizational turnover of IOTC&#8217; personnel (selected from the set of factors and indicators from previous researches and projects) and within the framework of the effects of the ethical work climate of DeConinck (2011) and Zhang et al. (2013)&#8217; ethical leadership model.

The aim of present study has been to evaluate psychological empowerment of managers and its effects on their attitudes toward strategic planning in the Department of Human Resources Development of National Iranian Oil Company. Hence, psychological empowerment of managers was defined based on Whetten and Cameron&#8217;s (1998) theory in five dimensions: Sense of meaning, Sense of competence, Sense of self-determination, sense of impact, sense of trust and attitude toward strategic planning process was defined based on Dincher, Tat Oglu and&#160; Gloucester&#8217;s (2006) model. In this regard, two main hypotheses and five sub-hypotheses were set. Statistical population of the study (n=542) involved all managers employed in this Department. Sample size of the study was obtained 225 using Cochran relation, being selected by classified random sampling method. The data collection tool was a questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was obtained by using Cronbach's alpha for questions related to psychological empowerment of managers and strategic planning attitudes of 0/889 and 0/909. One group t-test, Colmogrov-Smirnoff, Pearson Corelation and Regression tests were used at inferential level to test the research hypotheses. Results of the study indicated that psychological empowerment of the managers is at above average level. Moreover, findings of the study revealed that three aspects of psychological empowerment of the managers (i.e. sense of competence (0/287), sense of self-determination (0/182) and sense of meaning (0/567)) affect their attitude toward strategic planning. However, two factors of trust and efficacy, from among aspect of psychological empowerment of the managers, on their attitude toward strategic planning was rejected in the Department of Human Resources Development of National Iranian Oil Company.
