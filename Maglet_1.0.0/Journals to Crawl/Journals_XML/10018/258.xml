				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Innovation and creativity is one of the requirements of less developed human societies to move towards development. Innovation and creativity require a conflict of opinion, fair criticism, and an environment for effective interaction with humans. But there are factors such as "lack of criticism", "uncritical criticism", "inaccurate criticism" as incompatible parameters. Is. For this purpose, using content analysis method and interview tool, it was attempted to identify the phenomenon of criticism in university from functional and functional aspects. After conducting the research, it was found that the two main factors of expertise and the degree of conformity of expertise with the cash environment have a decisive effect on the efficiency of academic criticism. Three types of effective criticism, including specialized criticism, were identified as the best type of criticism, mediated criticism, and democratized criticism. Non-specialist entry fraud in specialized matters was also identified. Effective cash advancement tools and the prevention of cash misdemeanors were also introduced. At the end of the model of activation academic critique is presented.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Recently, many studies have been conducted in the open innovation context at the enterprise level to maximize the benefits and to control the challenges. Open innovation portfolio management studies are needed to bring integration between project and firm level. However, there is a few researches at project and portfolio level. This paper used previous theoretical foundations and a multiple case study method at ten ICT companies, utilizing a qualitative content analysis approach to analyze 23 semi-structured interviews and to derive a qualitative conceptual framework for open innovation portfolio management. The research findings are presented in five main categories including: strategic management in open innovation portfolio management; culture management in open innovation portfolio management; process management in open innovation portfolio management; stakeholder management in open innovation portfolio management and technology management in open innovation portfolio management. In this study, the area of technology management as a finding that has not been addressed in the literature and also the concept of charismatic management in the area of cultural management, the concepts of knowledge management, integrated market management and processes of the R&amp;D unit for the area of process management can be categorized as less mentioned concepts in the literature.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[A significant portion of defense projects are complex projects. Uncertainty and complexity are important and intrinsic features of these types of projects that increase their time and cost and some have pointed to the ever-increasing relationship between these concepts. Different approaches have been proposed, such as the development and deepening of the intrinsic capability to overcome the undesirable effects of these properties. In this study, uncertainty, complexity and capability are examined in a range of complex product development projects. At first, using the literature of the subject, referring to the experts and applying the three-stage Delphi method, the components of each of these three concepts were explained. Also, the distribution of questionnaires among managers and experts of defense industry, the importance of factors and performance of defense industries in management and improvement of these factors were evaluated and identified by means of significance-performance analysis, status of factors and priorities of improvement. The findings of this study indicate that organizations associated with complex defense product development projects in the areas of uncertainty, complexity, and capability should focus on the weaknesses of the organization's dominant culture, ambiguity in goals, changes in estimates, environmental factors, technical complexities, goals, project nature, Focus on the environment and knowledge management capabilities, value management, large-scale project management, and innovative capabilities that are higher priority than other factors.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Iran's business environment is a vibrant and unpredictable environment and operating in this situation requires special capabilities.Constant changes in this environment have made it difficult for companies to simply compete with existing capabilities and resource. The purpose of this article is to examine how a company (knowledge-based) can perform well in a turbulent environment by relying on its capabilities. Accordingly, theories of competitive advantage were examined and finally the theory of dynamic capabilities was selected as the appropriate theory. This article is assumed that the emergence of dynamic capabilities depends on the microfoundations formed in the company and these foundations could were embedded in three layers (human, social, organizational). We were extracted related variables in each layer based on the research literature an after interviewing with the company executives and staff, we were coded and placed them in their related layers. The results showed that human and social layers are very important in a FinTech and knowledge-based enterprise.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Changes in the business environment over recent years have led many large companies to seek asymmetric technological collaboration with small firms. However, because of the complexity and multidimensionality of collaboration process, their failure rate is high. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the success factors of asymmetric technological collaboration. However, most previous studies focused on the study of one specific factor or have been conducted in the context of developed countries. Therefore, the present article attempts to identify the essential factors for the success of collaboration by studying 8 cases (Multi-case study) of asymmetric technological collaboration in Iran's nanotechnology sector.The results of the analysis led to the identification of 16 essential success factors for asymmetric technological collaborations, including transparency of goals and tasks, alignment of technology with the requirements of large firms and information asymmetry]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Industrial companies face stiff competition in global markets nowadays, so they invest in R&amp;D projects to survive in the market and to reach the competitive advantage, but few of them succeed. To evaluate the success of R&amp;D projects and strive to improve them, unique criteria are required that are tailored to the specific characteristics of those projects. The purpose of this research is to identify and prioritize the success criteria of R&amp;D projects in Iran's Petroleum Industry Research Institute as the largest research institute in Iran. At first, the criteria for success in research and development projects were identified through a literature review as well as semi-structured interviews with experts from the Petroleum Industry Research Institute and then prioritized using the Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process. According to the results, 6 main criteria and 17 sub-criteria were identified for the success of these projects, which three criteria including technical, organizational and technology-knowledge among the main criteria and four sub-criteria including user satisfaction, creditworthiness, compliance with employer requirements and Impact on business organization among the identified sub-criteria, acquired the highest priority.]]></dcterms:abstract>
