	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The present study has been done to provide a model to promote organizational health in University of Applied Science and Technology. It is a descriptive survey. Statistical population were 5639 people and 700 people were chosen as a sample by random stratified sampling and they were examined by the researcher-developed questionnaire. To determine content validity of the questionnaire, the review of literature and experts opinion were excerpted; experimental implementation has been applied to determine face validity; and factor analysis was used to estimate construct validity, on the other hand, Cronbach&amp;alpha; was 0.795 which show reliability of the instrument. However, the status quo is lower than the average in all the mentioned components at Applied Science and Technology University. The conceptual model of study that include 19 components and 32 mechanisms has been developed, also the degree of model fitness has been judged by experts.&lt;/p&gt;
