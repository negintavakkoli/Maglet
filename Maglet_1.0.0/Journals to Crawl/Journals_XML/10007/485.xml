	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The most important characteristic of dome and factors influencing it in the Islamic Iranian architecture that is different from other courses is construction and construction methods of them. Over time, different factors are involved in the process of formation of the domes. It is one of the factors influencing the structure of Iranian-Islamic domes.&amp;nbsp;By examining the structure of Iranian-Islamic domes form can be read part of forgotten knowledge of architectural past among architects. This paper aimed to analyze the impact of changes on aspects of the architecture of dome. Other researchers on the review of the reports for reviewing and rethinking dome shows the analysis so far mainly structured approach to the process of the formation of the dome is recognized in Islamic Iranian architecture. Other researchers on the review of the reports for reviewing and rethinking dome shows the analysis so far mainly with structural approach recognized the process of the formation of the dome in Islamic Iranian architecture. &amp;nbsp;Analysis result show there is a clear distinctive relation between the dome and the size, height, form, shape and overall structure. This article is collection of library documents on the one hand and filed documents on the other hand. In this study, after the study of the certain structure of elements and measurement, sensitive and form relationships and relationship between components will be examined. &amp;nbsp;The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Islamic Iranian architecture and architectural structure of the dome. The investigation carried out revealed that resizing dome plans structure directly depend on form and method of making them.&lt;/p&gt;
