				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of economic freedom on the level of entrepreneurial activity in 17 innovative countries, from 2005 to 2014. In this study, we used the standard Fraser Economic Freedom Data and Entrepreneurship Global Monitor Entrepreneurship data. The panel data was analyzed in the Eviews9 and Stata14 software environment by generalized least squares estimation and ordinary least squares. The results of this research show that economic freedom has a significant relation with the level of entrepreneurial activity Among the indicators surveyed, the most impact on the level of innovative entrepreneurial activity in 17 innovative countries has been estimated by the Foreign Trade Freedom Index, regulation of rules and regulations, and security of property rights.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Global experience has shown that policymakers in both developing and developed countries have always used the leverage of the domestic market to enhance their country's technological capability as an important and effective policy instrument. In Iran, the most important policy in this area is the law of “maximal use of internal capabilities”, which despite the modification of the initial version in 2012, seems to have failed to have effectiveness for the economy of the country. In this study, by reviewing the history of the implementation of this law, related laws and regulations, and initial interview with experts, six main institutional categories were identified. Using the method of focus group and analyzing the content of the discussions and interviews conducted in six sessions, the institutional framework for increasing effectiveness of this kind of laws was proposed. According to the analysis, the most important institutional deficiencies in reducing the effectiveness of the law, were some issues like: the importance of a full project to Iranian companies and forcing them to improve its technological capability, the lack of a system of financing, the lack of sectoral innovation policy and regulation and lack of aggregation of public demand for increasing bargaining power.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Nowadays, evidence-based and data-based policymaking is taken into consideration in policymaking, so policymakers understand that until they don’t analyze micro data from firms, they could not form efficient and effective policies. One of the most important ways to measuring innovation is measuring its efficency. Measuring innovation efficeincy in macro level is more usual than micro level. In this paper, first, on the basis of previous reseaches, input and output indicators were identified. Then based on first Irarnian innovation survey data, innovation efficiency of four sectors (Nanotechnology. Biotechnology, Electronic, micro electronic and Telecomunication and Aerospace) firms were calculated and analysed, using Slack based DEA model. Finally, results show that 23.27% of nanotechnology firms, 20% of Electronic, micro electronic and Telecomunication, 18.33% of Biotechnology and 18.18% of Aerospace firms were efficent. In addition, the size of the firms in each sector were effective in firms efficiency.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Although science and technology collaborative networks (STCNs) have been studied and investigated for quite a while, the challenges of orchestrating these networks have received insignificant attention. In this paper, five collaborative networks in the field of strategic technologies laboratories, scientific laboratories, biotechnology, molecular medicine, and herbal medicine, established by the government agency in Iran in the years 2000-2018, were studied. In this paper, with systematic review of research, 41 challenges of the orchestrating formal collaborative networks of science and technology in Iran were identified at the level of network analysis. A researcher-made questionnaire was developed and distributed among the knowledgeable 5 selected collaborative networks, which were among the most active formal collaborative networks of science and technology in Iran. For analyzes, exploratory factor analysis and analysis of main factors and varimax rotation were used. Of the 41 indicators identified, 19 factor indexes were below 0.5 and excluded from the analysis, and 22 indicators in the second stage and after the rotation were classified in 6 categories. According to the characteristics of the indicators in the classes, 6 titles were named for the classes: 1- membership (2 indicators), 2- network structure (6 indicators), 3- network position (3 indicators), 4- knowledge mobility (3 indicators), 5- appropriability (3 indicators) and 6- Stability (5 indicators). In the end, research limitations were also presented.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The need for policy-making in any technological transition is to analyze its current situation. This paper is about the development processes of UAV technological niche in Iran. Therefore, first, based on theoretical foundations of the research, a questionnaire was developed for evaluating three development processes of technological niche, including "expectations and vision articulation", "network building" and "learning". Next, with the surveying tool, the current situation of the processes mentioned in the development of the UAV technological niche in Iran was evaluated and the strengths and weaknesses of their components were determined. It was found that all three processes are at a weak level. Of course, the status of the process of "expectations and vision articulation" is somewhat better. Also, the components of "attention to non-technical aspects", "interactions and participation of actors in the form of network" and "learning environment and the level of competition", the weakest components and the "level of innovative of expectations and vision", "the level of actors' lobbying power", "the formation of advocative coalitions", and "the quality and quantity of learning", the strongest components were recognized. Then, with a panel of experts, a qualitative analysis of the status of these processes took place. In the end, it became clear that it is a good applicable approach for analyzing the development of emerging defense technologies]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The importance of technology creating and investments requires tangible results in the area of the dissemination of applied knowledge created with the commercialization capability and transferring it to the market in the form of patent. However, there is no studies suggested the integrated framework for patent creation affecting factors. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors affecting the creation of patents and to explain how these factors are interconnected. This qualitative research, attempts to explore and extract the most important factors influencing the creation of patents using systematic review and meta-synthesis method. Finally, by extracting and encoding factors in the form of semantic codes and conceptual codes try to mapping the relation between them. Based on the results, the knowledge management, technology management services, patenting processes management, research and development activities and international interactions in research and development have the greatest role in balancing the patent creation affecting the factors. Such a study, will not only help recognizing the most important factors in this area by introducing the patent creation factors in a systematic method, but also, help policymakers to identify the most effective policies to promote innovation, Which improve the context for patent creating.]]></dcterms:abstract>
