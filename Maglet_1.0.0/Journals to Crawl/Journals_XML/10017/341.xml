Having collected the data, 148 questionnaires were analyzed in smart PLS software.  The findings revealed that transformational leadership has a direct effect on both psychological empowerment and knowledge management, while had an indirect effects on organizational innovations. Additionally, knowledge management entails direct and significant effects on organizational innovation, while playing a mediating role between transformational leadership and organizational innovation. However, the role of psychological empowerment mediator was not confirmed in this study.

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Selecting appropriate military site for deployment of a military unit is identified as determining factor in defense preparedness due to the special geographical and geostrategic situation of Iran, especially Ardabil province which is highly significant province in terms of its close proximity to the border of Iran. Moreover, selecting appropriate military sites for deployment of military units is capable of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of military units for dealing with military threats and crisis. Defensive-security observations are among the most important factors affecting the appropriate selection of military sites. Additionally, security and defensive components and criteria are also taken as the most determining factor in selecting appropriate military sites as well as establishing military units. As an analytical- descriptive study, this research was an attempt to analyze the optimal site for military establishment in Ardabil province based on defensive–security observations. To collect the required data, the study was conducted through investigating the defensive and security observations as well as utilizing the current resources and expert consultation. Having collected the data and weighing them in super decision software through running ANP model, the appropriate military site of military units were selected on the map in ARC GIS environment through utilizing the overlapping method of effective layers of site selection. Having analyzed the data, the optimal sites for military establishment were identified and zoned in this study. The findings revealed that from among total area of 17953 km of Ardabil province, 26.07 percent of total area of this region is totally inappropriate and  30.50 % of this area is inappropriate in terms of military site selection for military establishment in Ardabil province. The findings also revealed that 25.53 percent of Ardabil province is pretty appropriate, 13.12% of this region is appropriate and finally 4.76 percent of this province is wholly appropriate for military establishment.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The breakup of the soviet union led to the fundamental changes in international order including entrance of new actors in systematic interactions, structural transformation in dynamism and the balance of power as well as intensification of complexity and chaos in international system. Moreover, the ways of warfare has undergone massive changes and deeply affected by modern systematic transitions. Consequently, a new notion of warfare, namely hybrid which is extremely complicated and thoroughly resistive against conventional solutions was emerged as a result of systematic changes permeating in international context. The hybrid warfare is identified as a prevalent method of warfare in Middle East and this phenomenon have already had a major impact on regional security environment of Middle East. Additionally, hybrid warfare poses contemporary threats to the countries of the region. The continuance in this crisis revealed that in terms of the theories of international relations and strategic studies, no explanations of power is provided for hybrid warfare and therefore providing an explanation of modern models of hybrid warfare based on complexity and chaos theory is taken as the most crucial questions in strategic studies and international relations. The hypothesis of this study is to identify the components of hybrid warfare as well as providing answers to the questions of what kind of war the hybrid warfare is and how the hybrid warfare fights.  In terms of research hypothesis, this study was also an attempt to identify the strategies for dealing with hybrid warfare based on the theories of complex- chaotic system. Having analyzed the theories, research hypothesis is also proved by the research findings. This study is also aimed at expanding the boundaries of knowledge in terms of theory, and also helping the researcher to theorize on warfare in terms of strategy as well as developing an applied and analytical model for dealing with threats posed by modern warfare especially hybrid warfare. Finally, as a developmental-descriptive study and in terms of data collection procedures and analysis, this research was conducted through library study and content analysis. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

As an applied and descriptive-field study, this research was conducted through library and field study to collect the required data. Moreover, in terms of statistical populations, this study was also conducted through engaging sample population of 139 managers and commanders affiliated to the different managerial levels of military organizations who were expert in KM and IT issues and selected based on non-random sampling method.  This study was also run through administering researcher-made questionnaire among statistical population. The reliability of the questionnaire was estimated using Cronbach Alpha method releasing 0.875 through SPSS analysis and its content validity was confirmed by the experts. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics including Kolmogorov- Smirnov test and variance analysis were also run in this study. The findings revealed that from the viewpoint of managers and commanders, the situation of KM and IT of military organizations is pretty appropriate but it still stood below the appropriateness level. The research findings also revealed that there are significant differences among operational, senior, and middle mangers and commanders in terms of their viewpoints.]]></dcterms:abstract>
