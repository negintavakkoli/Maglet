				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Objective: A question that always arises for some practitioners and academicians is why stock prices in firms are not consistent with traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) models. Method: To this end, firms’ stock market prices should be analyzed on the basis of scientific principles. In addition, real options and their role in firms’ stock market value is an issue that has always been considered implicitly in practice and needs to be studied scientifically. Hence, this paper examines the relationship between a portion of the firm's stock market value that is due to real options and variables that are related to real options. Results:The results of the study, based on data from 140 industrial-productive firms during an 11-year period, indicates that in all three approaches, net income (NI), free cash flow to equity (FCFE) and free cash flow to firm (FCFF), a part of the firm’s stock market value is on average due to real options.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Objective: This research investigates the financing strategies of companies under normal and the economic crisis conditions over the years 2003-2016. Method: The statistical population of this research consists of companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange and Iran Over-The-Counter market (OTC). Research hypotheses have been tested through Multivariate Regression Equation. Results: The findings indicate that in both normal and crisis periods, the ROA (Return on Assets) and size of the company have a positive impact on the financing through the stock market. In addition, despite the negative impacts of sales growth, profitability, and average financial leverage on equity financing, tangible assets and market risk fail to indicate any effect on it. The results also demonstrate that the ROA and size of the company have negative effects on financing through the debt market over both normal and crisis periods. In addition, notwithstanding the negative impact of sales growth during the crisis period on debt financing, this effect is positive in the normal condition. Moreover, profitability and financial leverage have positive effects on debt financing during both normal and crisis times. Finally, it has been revealed that tangible assets have a positive impact on debt financing during the crisis period, but a negative effect during the normal period. Market risk has no effect on debt financing.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Objective:Hardly are traders inclined to indicate sentiment in the classical finance, however the behavioral finance paradigm shows that in some cases stock price changes have no fundamental triggers, and just the emotional tendency of the investors play the stimulant role in determining prices.
Method: Investor sentiment is defined as the tendency of market participants for speculation and this tendency can be related to the psychological state of the minds of investors. Given the fact that distressed traders are influenced by their emotions and the total emotion of the market, emotional tendency indicators are used to explain the behavior of these types of traders. In this research, the emotional tendency indicators are extracted in two ways: direct approach (survey method) and indirect approach (through the analysis of statistics and market data).
Results:Furthermore, this study, based on literature review and stock market conditions in Iran, applied the principal component analysis method (PCA) with different sentiment variables and indicators for extracting a composite sentiment index for extracting noise traders in Iranian stock market. Regarding the special value of the first component and the factor load (coefficients) of the variables, three variables are used in the final index. These three variables are: "Monthly volume of retail transactions by the volume of total stock trades", "Monthly volume of online transactions by the volume of total stock trades", and "Monthly volumes of stock trades by wholesalers and wholesalers by the volume of total market transactions".]]></dcterms:abstract>
