			<abstract>Nowadays, teams play a significant role in organizations&#039; success and competitive advantage. That&#039;s why managers and researchers are trying to find antecedences and factors affecting teams&#039; effectiveness. This study aims at evaluating the indirect effect of social rewards on team collaborative culture and knowledge sharing. The research is applied in terms of objective, and is correlational – descriptive in terms of methodology. Social rewards is considered as independent variable, knowledge-sharing and collaborative culture are considered as dependent variables, and team affective commitment is regarded as mediating variable. Quality control teams of companies that are located in Mazandaran province and produce automobile parts constituted the population of the research. Totally, 210 questionnaires were distributed. Validity of the questionnaire was approved by confirmatory factor analysis and its reliability was calculated as 0.83 by Cronbach&#039;s alpha coefficient. The results of the study indicate that social reward has a positive effect on team affective commitment. Moreover, team affective commitment has a significant and positive effect on team members&#039; knowledge sharing and collaborative culture.</abstract>

			<abstract>Rapid changes in science and technology have made the uncertainty a distinctive feature of our environment. The main reason for such changes is technology, and entrepreneurs are the technology creators. In our country, technological entrepreneurship, which in most authorities’ opinion is the key to technological and economic development, has not been explored so far. Although nearly a decade has passed since the establishment of science parks, and less than a decade has passed since the establishment of incubators to support technological entrepreneurs in the form of knowledge-based enterprises, little information exists on technological entrepreneurs, technological entrepreneurship, and new technology-based businesses or knowledge-based enterprises in the country. In this study, the model of technological entrepreneurship in knowledge-based firms in science and technology parks at national level has been examined. The research methodology is qualitative, including interviews and focus groups.</abstract>

			<abstract>Today, given the pervasive role of organizations in human lives and the status of justice in Islamic culture, the importance of justice in organizations has become more apparent than ever before. The aim of this research is to offer practical solutions to improve staff performance of University of Tabriz based on organizational justice. The research is applied in terms of objective, and its methodology is descriptive -correlational. The data was collected using a questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by experts and the questions’ factor analysis and the reliability were confirmed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The results of the structural equations modeling on the data collected from 236 questionnaires completed by the employees of University of Tabriz showed that organizational justice has a direct impact (with path coefficient of 0.86) and an indirect impact (with path coefficient of 0.54 and the perceived justice mediating role) on employees performance. It also has a positive impact (with path coefficient of 0.69) on perceived justice. Moreover, perceived justice (with path coefficient of 0.79) has a positive effect on employees’ performance.
perceived justice structure by path coefficient of 0.79 has a positive effect on employees performance.</abstract>

			<abstract>Knowledge sharing can be considered as an organizational behavior with a great importance which is affected by the other organizational behavior variables. This paper with a descriptive-survey approach, tries to investigate knowledge sharing behavior as a substantial aspect of knowledge management and to analyze its relationships with psychological empowerment and psychological capital as the main concepts of positive organizational behavior. Furthermore, the mediating role of organizational citizenship behavior has been regarded in the abovementioned relations and finally a framework has been presented which explains the relationships among these variable and concepts. Research questionnaire was distributed among a random sample of the Iranian Airports Holding Company. Collected data have been analyzed through different descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such as regression analysis and path analysis. Findings supported the presented conceptual framework and also verified the mediating role of organizational citizenship behavior in the relationships of psychological capital, psychological empowerment and knowledge sharing behavior. Furthermore, results revealed that the mediating role of the organizational citizenship behavior according to psychological empowerment is slightly greater than psychological capital.</abstract>
