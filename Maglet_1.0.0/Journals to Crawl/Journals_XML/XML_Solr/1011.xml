Since administering one city is an attempt to manage a spontaneous phenomenon, emerging cities and their evolution and growth are because of many decision that people make to determine place of living, work, establishing a company, financing resources, recreation, and education and so on. Each of these decisions has mutual impact on each other directly or indirectly in a complicated network of mutual exchange and cooperation. Peri-urban areas are one of the problematic ones in metropolis management, but political divisions is a concept that some consider it as the most basic issue facing management and governance of these areas. Political division is due to the expansion of metropolis areas beyond the confines of a single state territory such as municipality. Tehran Metropolis progress and urban-rural development in its per-urban environment, if land speculation is not controlled and there are no tool and mechanism to guide it systematically at different levels, will results in environmental, social, economic, quality of life, and ecological decline in the area. Thus, it has been tried in this research to study management literature of metropolis areas in addition to investigate issues that demand attention to management of peri-urban areas as well. One of the main goals of this research is to present policies in management system of peri-urban areas to improve inter-organization, intra-organization, and institutional interaction and integration. In terms of method, this research is descriptive-analytical. Given the research results, since Tehran district 22 is affected and formed by different factors and forces and it has been expanded in spatial territory of Metropolis surrounding, more attention and accuracy should be paid to its structural-functional management.Â </field></doc></add>
