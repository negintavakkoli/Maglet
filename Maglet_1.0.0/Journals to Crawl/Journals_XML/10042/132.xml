						<description>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:yekanyw;&quot;&gt;Housing-price is one of the indicators that help much to provide Housing projects through identification the factors effect on it. Checking the quality of residence and better understanding of investment opportunities to stimulate the development of urban fabrics - specifically fabrics that are being renovated- is required the detailed information of property prices. Tehran's Fatemi District has been faced with renovation, because this location has a special situation and high value of property large changes in housing prices. The spread changes of housing prices in this District will lead to the heterogeneities in the renovation and following it, reduction in integration of spatial District. This research has been studied with purpose of review the effective variables on housing prices, according to the research literature and empirical studies. These variables are include: building density, access to main thoroughfares, dilapidated areas and commercial lease prices and land area that in scale of block and were measured for the Whole of the District.

						<link>http://iueam.ir/browse.php?a_id=79&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman;&quot;&gt;According to increase of urban population in recent decades, if we want to response to modern requirements and share of resources for future generation in the development of cities, we should do a plan for managing the cities based on conscious participation of citizens. District based citizen participation in urban management is one of these fields and the main goal of this research. The methodology of the research is descriptive, analytical and survey. We also used research tools such as interview and researcher-made questionnaire to collect data. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for reliability was 0.86. also the validity of the questionnaire of teachers was positive. We used Vikor technic to analyze data. Usually this model is used to assessing the options that simultaneously prioritize the criteria and finally are a base for following conclusions. Bukan&amp;rsquo;s population -the statistical society of this research- based on the Census report of 1390 is 171773 people and the sample size of the research was 4oo persons that was calculated by Cochran formula and selected by random. The result shows that the citizens are not satisfied from the level of their participation in the Districts and this reflects the lake of their participation in their districts. Also the role of institutions (NGOS, City councils and associations) are at the second level of their dissatisfaction. Final level of dissatisfactions is at the group of urban management that based on points received in the model, shows the relative satisfaction of citizens. Since we have discussed the participation of the citizens of the city managers in this article, the performance or non-performance of urban managers, could not reflect an Optimized city. So, by creation different institutions at the district level, we can end to a stable relationship between the residents and urban managers (city council and municipality).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt line-height: 115% font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif&quot;&gt;&lt;!--stripped--&gt;&lt;!--stripped--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
