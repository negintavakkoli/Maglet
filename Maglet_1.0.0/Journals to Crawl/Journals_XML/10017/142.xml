To do so, due to the limitation of statistical population, the study was conducted through engaging total population of 82 company and battalion commanders affiliated to the military training centers of the Ground Force of Iranian Army. This study was also run through administering a valid and reliable questionnaire for data collection. To analyze the data, both descriptive and inferential statistics were run. Descriptive statistic was run in terms of data reduction, stratification and interpretation. To test research hypothesis, the inferential statistic was run through Spearman test, Pearson r and Stepwise Regression Analysis. The findings revealed that there is no significant correlation between demographic characteristics and interactional skills of commanders with soldiers affiliated to the military training centers of the Ground Force of Iranian Army in Tehran. Meanwhile, there is significantly positive correlation between organizational, environmental and individual factors and interactional skills of commanders with soldiers. Moreover, in terms of variance in the first stage of analysis, individual factors (28%) and on the second stage, environmental and organizational factors 35 percent of total variance of interactional skills of commanders with soldiers were indicated.   </abstract>

For data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative method including interview via expert consultation, document and library resources and mean test method were run. The mean tests of 131 questionnaires including 12 questions were estimated using Cronbach Alpha method releasing 0.887 The findings of the questionnaire and expert consultation revealed that the skill obstacles are of most significance while technical, structural and mechanism obstacles respectively enjoyed the significance.
