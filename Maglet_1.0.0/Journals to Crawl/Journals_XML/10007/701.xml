			<abstract>
			In this article, it has been tried to analyze the mental satisfaction of the quality of life in different regions in terms of objective development. For this purpose, districts no. 3, 6, and 9 of Mashhad city which through the measures of education, income, and employment were respectively among the deprived, the average, and the privileged regions were selected as the case study areas. Moreover, to measure the mental satisfaction of the local people of the quality of life, a questionnaire considering three basic dimensions of quality of life, i.e. economic, environmental, and physical sustainability (residential environment, the quality of these infrastructures) was designed. The sample size equals 385 people who according to the population of study area were divided into clusters. The research findings showed that there is little or no significant difference between these districts in terms of the desired measures, so that in terms of economic issues, the district no. 9 had a better condition than the other two. There was no significant difference between the districts no. 3 and 9. Regarding satisfaction of the quality of housing and infrastructure, the inhabitants in the district no. 6 showed less satisfaction than others. In this regard, no significant difference was observed between the districts no. 3 and 6; however, regarding satisfaction of the environmental situation, there was a significant difference between the districts no. 3 and 9, whereas the district no. 6 was an exception.&amp;nbsp;Generally, the district no. 9 in Mashhad has a better condition in terms of objective development, social status, and quality of mental life. In contrast, regarding these indices, the district no. 3 is among the poorest regions, so in terms of quality of mental life is in a average state. Yet, the district no. 6 due to its development and the middle social status has a less unfavorable condition in terms of the quality of life.

			<abstract>
			The intention of this paper is to define the concept of the spirit of place, and then to identify methods for its preservation in historical urban contexts. In fact, this study seeks to answer the question whether the spirit of the place and its components can be derived from tissue structure to improve? And whether we can weave his old identity in psychological indicators - human behavior found? Finally, the aim of this methodology is to help researchers make an objective analysis and evaluation related with the very delicate subject; the spirit of the place and its comprehensible meanings from tangible features to intangible ones. The study hypothesis claims that the psychological component concepts, behavioral and moral spirit of the place can be viable tissue residential neighborhoods. This claim qualitative research design and analysis of research by using descriptive derived from Kerman al-Ghadeer neighborhood residents use the results of the survey population. And the spirit of the place and identity of contingency tables between two components in the sample studied is proof space.

			<abstract>
			The problem which has been the focus of city constructors and architectures since the beginning of citizenship life is the issue of the nature of environmental quality. This study, with a review of explaining paradigms of environmental quality and by reliance on basic works, has assumed the question of nature of environmental quality an interdisciplinary concept (civic construction, sociology, psychology) and is in seek of explaining perceptive quality factors from citizens' perspective. Since the nature of this study is multidimensional and understanding of its different aspects and answering of its relevant questions bounds researcher both to test present theories and to understand mental world of his or her subjects, therefore, synthetic approach has been applied for methodology of it. It should be mentioned that Delphi method has been applied so as to obtain different indices and factors of the study. To determine the unit of sampling, multiple-stage clustering sampling method has been used in a way that between 22 regions of Tehran municipality, based on their development, first 6 regions were selected and in the next stage all the local states of those 6 regions were listed and then six local states were randomly selected. Size of the sample of this study is 200 persons. The results show that most of the perceptive factors derived from qualitative section of the research conform to factors derived from quantitative section and questionnaire. In other words factors derived from qualitative section are the same as those derived from quantitative factors. The significant point to notice in this section is that some of the derived factors from this section couldn&amp;rsquo;t be categorized by previous theories but rather they belong to the research community of this study (i.e. local states of Tehran). Thus we can state that the total perceptive criteria of environmental quality of these local states are as follows: legibility, place atmosphere, permeability, peace, tranquility, liveliness, sensational rapture, time sense, civil justice, security, human standard, sociability.

			Studies addressing such concepts as place, sense of place, place attachment, place identity, place dependence, rootedness, genius loci, topophilia, and place-making can be found in count-less disciplinary and applied fields devoted to the design, planning, stewardship, and restoration of places that vary in kind and scale from homes, neighborhoods, and cities to parks, and ecosystems. This article identifies opportunities and challenges to using sense of place as motivation for long-term stewardship at multiple spatial scales in a rapidly changing world. Sense of place reflects processes by which individuals or groups identify, attach to, depend on, and modify places, as well as the meanings, values, and feelings that individuals or groups associate with a place. The results of research show that An overview of the defined sense of place shows that sense of place is a result of the relationship of Man, his mental imaginations, and environmental characteristics. The concept, on the one hand, is rooted in the subjective experiences such as memories, traditions, history, culture, and society. It can be affected by the objective and external effects in the environment such as design, landscape, smell, and sound, on the other hand. Accordingly, sense of place is a complicated concept of the human feelings and attachment towards the environment that is produced due to the adaptation and use of place by the human. It means that sense of place has not been a predetermined event but results from the human interaction with the environment.

			<abstract>
			Many epidemiological studies have found that people living in environments with more green space report better physical and mental health than those with less green space. However, the association between visits to green space and mental health has seldom been studied. The environment surrounding residences and its recreational and commuting opportunities are believed to affect human health and well-being. Urban green spaces hold great potential for promoting an active life style that allows urban residents to achieve important health benefits. The type of urban green space that is most effective to reach the signals is still unclear. The objective was to systematically review the literature examining the relationship between quantity and quality of green spaces in the living environment and three health outcomes: perceived general health, perceived mental health, and (all-cause) mortality. This paper focuses on urban green space as one important type of urban open space and its relevance for human well-being. The result of research show further research should focus on exploring relationships between more detailed character-is tics of green space and more specific health outcomes in different population subgroups and in different countries. Quality of urban living and residents&amp;rsquo; way of life involves a complex interrelationship between a wide variety of physical environments and social opportunities. These, in turn, determine residents&amp;rsquo; physical and psychological needs. Due to unhealthy lifestyle, health promotion has become a prime concern in Malaysia because of the increase in life threatening illnesses. A proper green space planning is needed so that it facilitates urban residents with spaces for recreation, social and leisure activities. Unfortunately, Malaysia has not yet achieved a satisfactory degree of green space design and development to facilitate residents with a healthy environment. There are few restrictions on accessing and having contact with the urban green space due to planning and design issues.

			<abstract>
			During a very long period of time, civil engineers have been the only ones to be designated as the experts for underground space, while the planners and architects were the ones of the development at the surface. Cities worldwide tend to overlook an invaluable asset that lies beneath their surfaces. Most cities and urban regions are unaware of the benefits underground space use has to offer, both for climate inflicted and spatial constraints: In many cities, infrastructure development is being outpaced by population Growth. Climate change effects are requiring radical new approaches in terms of coping with for example excessive rainfall. The available space at the surface is rapidly being used up and the biggest danger is that built-up spaces are taking over the public green spaces of cities thereby threatening livability and quality of life. Urban underground space forms a societal asset, which is often unappreciated and underestimated in terms of the role it can play within dynamic city environments and associated challenges. The world-wide trend of increased urbanization creates problems for expanding and newly-developing cities alike. Population increase leads to an increased demand for reliable infrastructure, nowadays combined with a need for increased energy efficiency and a higher environmental awareness of the public. The use of underground space can help cities meet these increased demands while remaining compact, or find the space needed to include new functions in an existing city landscape. Use of Urban Underground Space (UUS) has been growing significantly in the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest and wealthiest cities. UUS has been long acknowledged to be important to the urban development agenda: sustainability, resilience, livability, and creating a better urban environment in particular.

Corporate architecture is an architectonic discipline which focuses on designing and constructing buildings, spaces or environments with the aim of meeting the needs of a business community. Its objective is spatial perception of corporate values by the company&amp;rsquo;s employees and customers because for motivation and communication, conveying the corporate values and philosophy clearly is of essential significance for success. Place identity could best be understood as that which makes a place unique. The identity concept from the point of cities and architectural products includes a wide definition covering natural, geographical and cultural products and social life norms. Urban identity, architectural identity and the urban images about them are sometimes formed by very different components in a long period in urban space. In recent days, we often come across with the problem of cities to enter a new architectural and urban formation process in a dimension of losing their original identities. In this context; the city identity is formed in the togetherness of urban participation and natural and cultural values which are required to preserve, unique architectural and spatial characteristics, social accumulation and life style. City identity concept having spatial, social, cultural and economical dimensions should be handled with a totalitarian approach, it must be qualified as a collective result including the urban participation and every interaction which provided the city to reach social participates.

			<abstract>
			Due to its neighborhood with Afghanestan and the subsequent problems of this country such as insecurity, weak economic conditions, and lack of proper border monitoring, Khorasan Razavi Province has always been the inhabitat of numerous foreign nationals. Legal and illegal entry of these people has created plenty of issues from different economic, social, and cultural aspects for the citizens of this province. Negative consequences arising from the presence of foreign nationals on one hand and threats that may form from the Trans powers (using the nationals) have emphasized the necessity of considering the passive defense issue. &amp;nbsp;So, one of the issues that requires further investigation is the security implications of foreign nationals in Khorasan Razavi province in terms of a passive defense approach. The main question of the current research is that of regarding the passive defense viewpoint, how the presence of the foreign national affects the security of Khorasan Razavi province and the Islamic Republic of Iran in general. This study has a cross-sectional study approach and through library studies, along with a comprehensive perspective, different threats are identified in the field. Proposing practical solutions, it attempts to take effective measures in controlling such consequences.

			<abstract>
			Nowadays, one of the topics of interest to researchers is the authority of teachers, and fades it in universities. Look at the reality in the society and comparing with historical context motivates researchers to question why some of the professors at the university have less authority. For this purpose, this research is trying to focus on economic and demographic factors, to answer questions. The method used in this research is descriptive analysis using survey techniques and data collection tool is a questionnaire. The population consisted of professors of Kermanshah PNU in the academic year 2011-2012, total number of them is equal to 258. Due to the large size of the population, using the Lin sampling table sample size is 258, which for the study based on striated random sampling were selected. In the present study, face validity assessment method and construct validity based on factor analysis were used. To determine the reliability of the statements of each variable, Cronbach's alpha used. Results using SPSS21 and Amos21 statistical software were analyzed. Mean traditional authority equal to 13.57, then charisma authority13.54, and intellectual authority is 18.72. The dimensions compared with the average expected for above dimension respectively traditional authority 15, charisma authority 12, intellectual authority is 15. The results show that there is a significant relationship between relative deprivation and professor&amp;rsquo;s authority (r=-0.301), the use of mass media and professor&amp;rsquo;s authority (r=0.161), monthly income and professor&amp;rsquo;s authority (r=-0.153). In addition, the results of comparison show that average of the professor&amp;rsquo;s authority among the courses is different, and this difference based on f test is significant. The average professor&amp;rsquo;s authority, for people with different degrees is different. The results of Multiple regression indicate that the traditional authority (T=4.335), self-esteem (T =3.925), charismatic authority (T =3.788), and the relative deprivation (T =-2.287), total 0.42 from internal changes explain the value of professor&amp;rsquo;s authority variables. Furthermore, the results of structural equation shows that Chi square insignificant CMIN is equal to 211.143, square root index mean residual square or RMSEA is equal to 0.075, RMR index or residuals mean square root is equal to 0.098, the Chi-square to the degrees of freedom ratio CMIN.dF in model is 3.199, against the CFI comparative fit index 0.926, and comparative fit index thrifty PCFI, are equal to 0.671 Comparative and thrifty indicators for evaluating the overall model calculated that show collected data to support the theoretical model considered.

			Value stream mapping because of being able to understand process bottlenecks, as one of the most common tools for analyzing, identifying and eliminating various losses in operational and support processes are used. On the other hand, inventory management, precise control entry and exit of goods, accurate and timely information about the inventories status and planning, reduce product maintenance costs, including important issues organizations have a special look to it to consider the whole objectives and strategies, making procedures and policies that have a positive effect on the overall organization&amp;rsquo;s economy. In this paper, the use of value stream mapping as a lean production technique, in a production process to improve inventory control is discussed. This is a tool seeks to reduce losses, especially losses related to inventory by mining a bearing manufacturer companies. In this study, the literature of value stream mapping considered. The current state and future state of the company drawn in order to improve production process and losses in the company's future status. In addition, after drawing the mapping, the results of the simulation software Arena and the final report suggests that the use of this technique has an impact on reduce losses and increase inventory turnover.

			This research aimed to identify the dimensions, components, priorities and distinction between existing and desired condition, organizational forgetting management and provides a model for appropriate mechanisms for controlling it at university. The research in term of goal is practical and giving quantitative data and method is descriptive-survey research. In order to validate the measurement, content validity has been used and to assess the reliability the Cronbach's Alpha has been applied. The study population consists of faculty and staff at Islamic Azad University in district eight. Considering the total size of faculty and staff at Islamic Azad University (13117), sample size is determined (375). According to the main question of this research, some theoretical studies and exploratory ones based on existing documents, questionnaires and interviews with experts were done. Questionnaires have been distributed and analyzed, then current and ideal situation were identified. Therefore, the statistical tables were prepared and described. To do so, inferential statistical methods have been used with SPSS and Lisrel so that the relationship between variables can be measured and the four management aspects of the research consisting of process, technology, culture and structure are determined to evaluate the organizational forgetting management. By comparing the conditions and dimensions in current and ideal state, a considerable gap was found between the two mentioned states. On the basis of the analyses, the strengths and weaknesses were found and the mechanisms to eliminate this gap were expressed.

			Prisons come at great cost to society and still result in inmates disassociated from society. Incarceration is however our primary forms of punishment; therefore we need to define the purpose of punishment to be integrated into our goals for prisons. Prison architecture is a complex area of study, the classification proposed in this paper can be an important research tool by taking into consideration a holistic approach to the domain. The physical environment of the users is a large factor, but architecture can only be influential when coupled with policy reform. To achieve this, one must look after both the physical and psychological well-being of the inmates. We can observe four models of prisons: the rehabilitation model, the safety model, the repressive prison model and the hybrid model. Each model is a response at the social and cultural characteristics of the area were the prison is build. Each model is different from the others, by the architectural approach. The main variations between the models are concerning the security systems, the prison facilities and the design. The philosophy behind this concept is the understanding that an occupied prisoner is less violent and is less likely to assault the staff or other inmates.

			<abstract>
			on one hand, Iran due to the low annual rainfall and lack of appropriate spatial and temporal distribution in precipitation is considered as an arid and semi-arid country experiencing stress and water scarcity; on the other hand, 90% of annual water consumption has been allocated to agriculture sector in Iran and efficiency and productivity of water consumption do not enjoy favorable status in this sector. While it can overcome this problem by use of virtual water criterion in trade with the countries which enjoy water status such as Turkey. In this regards, the present study has examined this issue in form of selected agriculture goods based on common indices for detection of trade opportunities. Cosine criterion indicated that the degree of similarity and complementary of Turkey&amp;rsquo;s export with Iran is greater than structural similarity of Iran&amp;rsquo;s export with Turkey. With regard to trade potential calculations, Iran and Turkey have high export capacity in trade of agriculture goods. Further, Index&amp;nbsp;of Drysdale indicated that the possibility for development of trade from Turkey to Iran is greater than trade from Iran to Turkey and ultimately adjustment of Balasa&amp;nbsp;index based on virtual water trade process indicated that Iran should change its import and export priorities at area of agriculture products. Further, results from research indicate that applying virtual water criterion and removing the products lacking relative advantage in trade between Iran and Turkey result in increase in export of Turkey&amp;rsquo;s agricultural products to Iran and increase in Iran&amp;rsquo;s benefit in trade of virtual water.

			<abstract>
			It seems that success in municipal wastes management has a detectable relationship with citizens' participation and social mechanisms. So, the present study has done for recognition of systematic relations of effective social parameters on municipal solid waste administration. Data have collected in two phase to fill of questionnaires including awareness assessment of MSW office's personnel of urban 22-district Tehran municipality organization and effective factors on MSW management; Then, social parameters relations effective on MSW via S-LCA in different phases such as temporary storage, gathering, transportation and processing, recycling and proper disposal. Results shown that was got 16 grading (than 20) of municipal waste administration awareness by personnel of MSW office in district that has counted including good grades. Waste management of district municipality has got final grading equal 72 (than 100) that shown have good performance (71-90), but the worst was source separation of waste with grading 24 (than 40) rather than other stages. The most important social factor effective on waste's LCA has were social acceptability that got more final weight (0.49) and among these indices such as noise pollution and private space have more importance. Then, social performance and equality play a same role that social performance in addition to the recycling of start point, destination and job creation, be influenced by social acceptability; Social equality is influenced by distribution and locating index, as well as, quality employment. Average of normal values for indices of each component in different scenarios has shown transfer station scenario has the highest ratio of social acceptability (1.8) and performance (0.7) and caused low amount of social impacts. In other side, landfill scenario (direct way) has the lowest normal value of social equality (0.8). Albeit, due to the weight of social acceptability of first scenario (temporary storage of waste in transfer station and transfer of them to final landfill waste), is desirable, environmentally has advantages than two other scenarios, such as direct job creation, lower fuel consumption and visual pollution prevention.

			<abstract>
			The most important characteristic of dome and factors influencing it in the Islamic Iranian architecture that is different from other courses is construction and construction methods of them. Over time, different factors are involved in the process of formation of the domes. It is one of the factors influencing the structure of Iranian-Islamic domes.&amp;nbsp;By examining the structure of Iranian-Islamic domes form can be read part of forgotten knowledge of architectural past among architects. This paper aimed to analyze the impact of changes on aspects of the architecture of dome. Other researchers on the review of the reports for reviewing and rethinking dome shows the analysis so far mainly structured approach to the process of the formation of the dome is recognized in Islamic Iranian architecture. Other researchers on the review of the reports for reviewing and rethinking dome shows the analysis so far mainly with structural approach recognized the process of the formation of the dome in Islamic Iranian architecture. &amp;nbsp;Analysis result show there is a clear distinctive relation between the dome and the size, height, form, shape and overall structure. This article is collection of library documents on the one hand and filed documents on the other hand. In this study, after the study of the certain structure of elements and measurement, sensitive and form relationships and relationship between components will be examined. &amp;nbsp;The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Islamic Iranian architecture and architectural structure of the dome.

			Green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building that minimizes harmful effects on human health and the environment. The &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; architect or designer attempts to safeguard air, water, and earth by choosing eco-friendly building materials and construction practices. So, green architecture is Building and structure design philosophy that aims at minimal use of non-renewable and/or polluting materials and resources in construction and use of a facility. Today, architecture finds itself at a crossroads. Building materials and new construction, along with the operation and maintenance of buildings, account for a significant sum of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Faced with this fact, how are architects to responsibly pursue the act (and art) of building without further deteriorating the planet's environmental make-up or depleting its resources? What forms of high and low technology can be developed to curtail the injurious side of building? Can good or even great architecture be sustainable? In this paper discuss the problem such as: The Future Is Green: Architecture + Sustainability and have been surveyed Green Architecture and&amp;nbsp; impacts of it on urban planing and urban design.

			<abstract>
			The purpose of current article is to study the effect of sense of place on creating the urban identity in new cities. In order to fulfill the mentioned purpose, the key concepts of research and the theories related to the issue were studied. According to it, in order to collect the data, library method and note taking tool were used. The studies indicated the presence of human in the environment and the perceptions arising from physical-spatial structures, social-activity structures, individual-mental structures as the result of defining the meaning of environment convert the space's environment to the place. This definition of meaning has led to the positioning of person in the face of place and it is effective on the quality and quantity of his presence at present and future in that special place. This positioning has been expressed in the frame of sense of place and according to this sense, linking the person with the place is formed. This sense can be equal more and less for a set of persons in the frame of social groups. Different levels from indifference-placelessness to awareness, dependency, affection, commitment and finally loyalty and sacrifice are determined for sense of place. The sense of place is effective on formation of individual and social identity by linking the person to the place and also the dependency sense to the place. The identity of place is also influenced by the sense of place. In other words, individual identity can be found in the special and unique features of him/her and also in the features of a society in which he has been present as a member of it. A place that person is present is also added to the mentioned phrase and therefore, the identity of human will be influenced by individual, social and spatial features. Therefore, it can be said that citizenship identity is influenced by the identity of place and in wider interpretation spatial identity or identity of city.
