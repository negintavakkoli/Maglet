	<abstract_fa>Rural tourism is considered as one of the important parts of the economic activities. This important economic activity in the different views has been taken into consideration. Some know it as a part of the tourism market and some consider it as a policy for rural development. Rural tourism quickly grew in the rural economic and has been the complementary of agricultural activities. The nature of the tourism industry is, create employment, income, diversification, economic, increase of cultural level, community participation and use of local resources. Development of tourism in rural areas, in addition to diversifying the economy and developing its infrastructure, can be a step towards sustainable development in rural areas and social justice by creating jobs, and reverse migration. In general, supporting the village pristine tourist areas and rural tourism, cause to create different and good employment opportunities, increase of national income, the promotion of social welfare and the development of sustainable tourism in rural areas. Rural tourism through influence and effect on all aspects of rural life, leads to grow them both in terms of economic and socio-cultural. This study investigates the efficacy of wooden cottages in attraction of tourism in the city of Masal. A tourism model that has been used in this study, is taking advantage of Gibz- Martin method, the obtained results of the regression analysis of this study indicate that among the several factors of tourism attraction in this region, wooden cottages are known as one of the best resorts of tourism attraction. Studies are conducted in four villages of Masal that Hoome village with 200 wooden cottages and 5000 tourism with amount of 0.85 has the maximum amount of tourism in the region and also wooden cottages are known as a way to attract tourism in the region.

	<abstract_fa>Today each city due to natural limitations, facilities and planning policies has different growth pattern which according to its spread, has different consequences and results. Although there is a wide range of urban growth patterns, but the important thing is not diversity and number of models but is the absence of rules and methods of transition from one to another pattern (form). So this article review and analysis ways which we can achieve this transition in the pattern of urban growth. Evidence shows that in order to transition from the pattern of automobile-dependent city (modern) to post-industrial and post-modern models, there are different approaches, including urban containment, urban consolidation policies, new urbanism, smart growth, emphasis on infill development and transit-oriented development and it is considered that the most important thing in all of them, is the relationship between land use and urban transport. In fact, the key of many compact city debates is transit-based transportation systems and urban mixed landuse that reduces use of machine and limits travel time for commuters. Also transition has multi-level perspective: first are niches (technological innovation in transport and landuse, second are regimes (regulation and governance that provides appropriate frameworks, guidelines and rules for transition) and finally are landscapes (the broader conditions, environment and pressures for transition).

Basic topics such as proper location, optimal allocation, diversification, functionality and &amp;hellip which are in direct contact with comfort goals, are the last objectives of urban planners and designers. One of the major issue, which has been paid less attention to, is the incorporation of urban land use. In this paper, which were prepared to assess the incorporation of urban land use and its role in urban sustainability, tried to measure the rate of the incorporation of seven metropolitan areas of Ahvaz by using the Shannon entropy and the latest statistics of related to per capita and percentage of exist land use.

	<abstract_fa>Today, Information Technology services are considered as valuable resources in all areas. For making Information Technology Management Processes purposeful and efficient in different organizations &amp;ndash as a competitive and strategic advantage (especially in organizations responsible for health care services) &amp;ndash it is necessary to recognize the level of maturity of the organization and review its processes in the field of Information Technology Services. On the other hand, finding the relations between main components of maturity and Information Technology Standards are essential to make them functional. In this paper, in addition to recognizing the present IT Management Services and prioritize them we reviewed the gap between processes and compare them to provide related maturity levels for introducing a localized model in Information Technology Services maturity in organizations responsible for health care services. Therefore, with the help of health experts and professionals working in health organizations we categorized indicators in 10 management processes and 9 criteria related to it. In addition, we evaluated overlapping levels of maturity and ITIL management processes by using experts opinions that have a high percentage of consensus in the field of selecting criteria. The aim of deriving these indicators was creating a functional tool in health organizations and paying attention to its main differences with other methods in addition to inspiring from CMMI and entering effective components on Information Technology Infrastructures Standard (ITIL) framework according to functional views in Information Technology Management Services at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The present study can be recognized an applied research in accordance with its goal. In this research, a proposed instrument is used for gathering data (ITILRA questionnaire) from health care centers of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The aim was determining the gap between current organizations management processes with an optimal one in the field of IT services (which are at different levels of maturity) with respect to the ITIL.V3 framework. For this reason, leveling joint processes between ITIL and CMMI and approving corresponding indicators at Information Technology Services Maturity Model levels were done and each criteria and processes were compared with ideal and standard situation separately. Then, we determined the highest and lowest differences rates and standard deviation for creating a localized maturity model based on ITIL. In management process, Service Desk has the most close and overlapped situation with ideal condition. In Configuration Management, the highest differences and gap was recognized, so, it should be closer to optimal condition. Service Desk belongs to Service Operations phase and it indicates the maturity level of the organization. As it was expected, it was in a very desirable condition. Configuration Management Process belongs to Translating Service Phase which stood in third place (predetermined processes) of maturity level in CMMI Model. It shows that improving maturity level of the organizations needs more efforts for reducing or omitting any gap between the current situation of the organization and a desirable condition. All these scores (by mean and standard deviation tests) obtained using SPSS software.

Then, we determined the highest and lowest differences rates and standard deviation for creating a localized maturity model based on ITIL. In management process, Service Desk has the most close and overlapped situation with ideal condition. In Configuration Management, the highest differences and gap was recognized, so, it should be closer to optimal condition. Service Desk belongs to Service Operations phase and it indicates the maturity level of the organization. As it was expected, it was in a very desirable condition. Configuration Management Process belongs to Translating Service Phase which stood in third place (predetermined processes) of maturity level in CMMI Model. It shows that improving maturity level of the organizations needs more efforts for reducing or omitting any gap between the current situation of the organization and a desirable condition. All these scores (by mean and standard deviation tests) obtained using SPSS software.

	<abstract_fa>Cities have been consisted of many eroded textures. The renovation designs have been provided due to many problems the residents face with.  These designs are not always successful. Lack of specific pattern or enough experience regarding the intervention in the eroded textures and no suitable and enough attention to the public cooperation are some of the reasons of these designs failure. Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate the intervention in the eroded textures with an overall insight to the experiences of some countries. Paying attention to the social, cultural and economic status of the residents, providing the required infrastructures, paying attention to the ownerships, and promoting the public cooperation level are the important indices in most of the renovation designs. The purpose of the present research is to study the role of renovation and reconstruction in the world`s eroded textures descriptively. The experience of other countries have different ways of modernizing the social, economic, cultural and especially provided in partnership with samples being analyzed and then a series solution is given in the form of recommendations.

	<abstract_fa>The globalization and urban development concepts are closely linked to each other. However, all cities around the world are not affected same by globalization, each one has its spatial and reciprocal international-local action. The international changes of economy, culture, and politics have huge effects on restructuring of cities around the world. The present study as a descriptive-analytical study aimed at investigating the regional-urban development indexes of Chabahar Port as well as analyzing the improvement conditions of commercial activities resulting from globalization process. To collect the data required in the study, precise library and field studies were done. The population of the study includes the inhabitants of Chabahar, 85633 people according to nation-wide census of 1390. By applying the Cochran sampling method, 380 persons were selected as participants to fill the questionnaires. In order to analyze the data, the one-sample T test and SPSS software were used. Based on the findings of the study, the mean of regional-urban development indexes of Chabahar Port is 3.17 and the T statistic is 4.955. Hence, the influence of globalization process on the regional-urban development process is nearly average, as a result the regional-urban development indexes of Chabahar Port are in a good condition. Among the regional-urban development indexes, the &amp;ldquocommunication&amp;rdquo index statistic with 10.818 and the &amp;ldquoHousing&amp;rdquo index statistic with 5.538 more than other indexes affected by the globalization process and trade development.

	<abstract_fa>This research aims to study the role and function of economic-social nongovernmental organizations' frontier cooperatives in sustainable development with emphasize on developing cooperatives in frontier regions. In this research study the position, function and performance of cooperatives of four frontier cities including Agh Gola city, Gaz port city, Turkman port city and kelaleh were selected, studied and analyzed. The method of study was descriptive-analytical and data documental collection was analyzed in three dimensions of sustainable development including economic, social and environmental by using econometrics (OLS). The results of data analyses have showed that the activities of nongovernmental organizations such as frontier cooperatives of these regions leave the most effects respectively in the field of social,  economic  and  environmental  indicators.  In  the  other  word,  through  development  in frontier cooperatives and expansion of their activities in borders, at first they had the most positive effect in development of social indicators and at the second degree , they had effect on economic and environmental indicators and dimensions and the relationship between frontier cooperatives' innate duties and their further development with sustainable development of border and central regions is always significant and some strategic programs must be planned in these fields and its relative dimensions.

	<abstract_fa>Iranian formal  censuses indicate that the share of rural population in total population of Iran have been decreasing over the time and many villages are uninhabited. Migration statistics in Iran have also indicated intense migration from villages to the cities during the past half- century.  Many researches have been conducted due to the importance of rural-urban migrations, during the past few years. Therefore, the main goals of this study are to criticize and evaluate the written articles using meta-analysis method in rural-urban migrations field and to identify the most important factors affecting rural-urban migrations, widely used theoretical approaches  in this area and etc. The findings of this research show that attraction and repulsion viewpoint and Michael Todaro&amp;rsquos theory are appropriate theoretical approaches to state the problem of rural-urban migrations in Iran. Also, urban attraction variables with impact size of 0.75 and occupation with impact size of 0.62 have the most effect on rural-urban migration. Other findings indicate that the most solutions proposed in the reviewed researches are general, vague and non-executive and there is no proportionality between the proposed solutions and the study objectives in most cases.
