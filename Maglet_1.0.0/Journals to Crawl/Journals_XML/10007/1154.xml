	<abstract language="eng">With regard to the personality dimensions of individuals, scientists have presented various views and divided various categories. Among these, one can point to the extensive research of two scientists, John Atkinson and David McKell Land. In their studies of personality and its related aspects, they classify people into three categories of successful, empowered and those who need to belong. Each of these three groups of personages behave in a special way, have certain expectations of their work, have unique abilities and behavioral skills, and ultimately have different needs. In general, individuals with different characters, different behaviors, expectations, needs, and motivations are different. On the other hand, organizations also need specific behavior. Expectations, needs and motivations can be provided. As a result, each type of personality is compatible with each other and with specific occupations. This research seeks to characterize the impact of personality on the performance of employees of branch 18 of the Social Security Organization and determines that with regard to each organization's occupation and the nature of their work, what type of staff, what level of needs and what kind of personality pattern will have a higher performance. As a result of this study, it will be determined that with regard to each of the occupations in branch no. 18 of the Social Security Organization and their nature, what type of staff of the organization and with what needs or personality pattern can be used to provide a higher performance for the organization and employees of the organization And how can the organization's businesses be designed so that employees can perform better?

	<abstract language="eng">The house is cultural freedom that separates us from the other. And at the same time, it enables our life and our coexistence with others. The concept of privacy and individuality are cultural concepts that vary from culture to culture. In societies where individualism is more developed and individualistic values overcome, privacy in both spatial and social terms is one of the key concepts of social life. On the other hand, the phenomenology of the concept of housing is that it can play a fundamental role in the architectural and urban design process. And the context in which the designer of the city or the architect is tied up is of fundamental importance. This article also addresses this issue. Given the descriptive-analytical method and the rational reasoning method with data collection tools: library and solar studies have been addressed to the aforementioned issue. Finally, the views of Martin Heidegger and Christine Norberg Schultz are briefly explained in the nature and concept of housing.

	<abstract language="eng">This article is written to identify some hidden factors influencing the perception of architectural space. One of the comments in the context of today's contemporary architecture is the architectural space and how it is perceived. In the meantime, experts such as Peter Zumthor, Juhani Pallasmaa, Rudolf Arnheim, Benjamin, Marc Aug&amp;eacute; and so have ideas about the manner of perception of architectural space. But the architects have always been raised to believe that a tool for revealing space it is not sufficient that there are elements in the perception of architectural space that architects aren't able to transfer them from the available tools because these components include components that are not previously known. Components that are perhaps have equal importance with other external factors. Make changes in the type of each of them has serious effect on human perception of space. The purpose of this article is recognition and attention to the hidden aspects that have a significant role in the perception of architectural space but are often neglected. Knowing these components help architects improve the quality of their designs by identifying factors that influence the perception of architectural space. The posed research question in this research is that: What are the hidden factors that influence the perception of architectural space? And how each of these components is perceived through the user of space? Finally, by more recognition of the hidden factors that influence the perception of architectural space, the spaces can be tailored to the needs of modern man's Creator, so that he can be somewhat of a permanent wandering past in the hope of being saved. Creating spaces that not only for today's needs, but also carries features that link the supplier of the inside and outside senses and can prevailing human senses simultaneously and can be held accountable.

	<abstract language="eng">An Urban Planners as someone who deals with the body of the city, has to notice the observer and external factors affecting him, as well as images of the environment made in his mind .Receiving the images from different environments by people with different conditions (in terms of age, gender, culture, attitude...) is sometimes difficult and sometimes easy; but there are several similarities among mental images of people. These common similar images are indeed the result of public consensus on the importance of specific image. And this is common mental image that attracts the attention of urban planner; because the environment that urban planner creates would be used by many people. Accordingly, common mental image of people must be considered to achieve city structure. The elements and relationships of the spatial structure of the city are recognized by extracting the elements got important in common mental image of people. Urban designer can be effective on the objectivity that is created by this mental image to enhance the quality of the city structure .According to Gordon Cullen, designer can strengthen the stages of mental image formation (perception and recognition) by manipulating city structure and also creates a sense of place. It has been tried in the present thesis to recognize the structure of historic fabric of Kerman city by using mental image of Kerman people and also attempt to form a clear mental image from city structure and promote the quality and strengthen the sense of place by suing mental perceptions of residents.

Data collection instrument in this study is researcher-made questionnaire containing 69 items. According to the theoretical framework of research, the questionnaire was made and its validity was confirmed through survey of experts and the Cronbach's alpha was obtained to 0.823 for the expert population and was obtained to 0.834 for the population of ordinary people and this shows reliability and consistency of internal components of the questionnaire. To determine sample size in the population (clients of Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran), random sampling was used based on Morgan table and the sample size was determined to 384 people. In the statistical population of experts (representatives of Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran), nonrandom sampling was used and 290 people were selected as sample. According to existence of 2 different populations, to compare the opinions of two groups under existing status (population) and desired status (experts), independent t-test and significance-performance were used. The results obtained from data analysis showed that in all components, the gap between existing and desired status is evident. The highest gap observed is related to the political index of citizen's discretion and the lowest gap is related to inaccessible indicator of information components. Hence, to decrease the gap between existing and desired status of components and to help enhancement of participation, some suggestions and solutions are provided in field of components and indices and damages.

	<abstract language="eng">Abstract
People use different ways to communicate with each other and the surrounding environment, one of which is the use of visual senses. The Gestalt psychology school is very influential in visual perception because the human nervous system eliminates the simplest design in every situation, and this can be seen in the geometry of brick designs, and its analysis can reveal the visual structure of brickwork. To make In fact, the Gestalt approach provides a solution to the effect of the method and angle of arrangement and the type of bricks used, as well as the distribution of colors on the visual perception behind the vaults of the Hakim Mosque in Esfahan. in this regard, researchers have examined visual perceptions in paintings and street paintings, and in terms of the geometry of brickwork and in terms of gestalt erosion, they have not been investigated. This comparison for the first time examines the visual perception of the geometrical view of bricks behind the courtyards of the Hakim Mosque with the Gestalt approach. The methodology of the research is qualitative and based on the purpose of the application and analyzes the visual perception of the geometry of brickwork based on library and field information. In this way, research data in the field of visual structure and geometry of brickwork are firstly extracted and then the analyzes are done according to the rules of the gestalt on motifs. As a result of the analysis, it was observed that Gestalt rules are greatly related to the geometry of brickwork.

	<abstract language="eng">Indigenous architectural elements are shaped more than any other factor influenced by environmental and climatic factors. Climate as a determinant factor has led to the emergence of different types of architectures in different climates. The courtyard is one of the elements of indigenous residential architecture, which has played a major role in human life especially in Iran and Iranian architecture, as various climatic conditions have occurred in different areas under the influence of environmental conditions. The significance of this element is that, as an architectural space, it can be the interface between the biological spaces and the outer space and act with its impact on environmental conditions itself as a subtlety. Accordingly, in this article, through descriptive-analytical method and content analysis method, the position and role of the courtyard in the climatic architecture of Iran especially in residential buildings has been investigated. In cold and dry climate, the result related to its position in designing Concordance with the climate has been mentioned. At the end, the results of this study have been described in detail both qualitatively and conceptually.

	<abstract language="eng">Due to the nature of phenomenon in phenomenological approach is important. the research takes its course in a way that first, identification and method selection and selection of techniques based on new patterns, but on the basis of documents and information related to the main theories is carried out. The design process is based on two main stages and their subcategories, and the role of each has been reviewed with phenomenological approach. And finally, operation of strategic techniques including mapping technique as ways to convert the phenomenon to matter in the design process with a phenomenological approach to sensory perceptions is considered. As a result of this study, a model for the design process with phenomenological approach to sensory perceptions is presented which in turn contains strategies for conversion of phenomenon to matter in the process of architectural design. It is noteworthy that in the presented model, in the identification stage and selection of the requirements, discursive and argumentative approaches are relied upon in addition to sensory encounters with the subject. Finally, this study can present the following theory: design based on phenomenological approach to sensory perceptions is directly linked to the environmental factors. Therefore, the use of techniques and measurement tools of qualitative and quantitative criteria of environment such that preliminary data do not lose their properties and inherent nature is essential in the process of design and its implementation methodology. Presenting strategies in the design process with phenomenological approach to sensory perceptions can be designed, but not with certainty at all stages. The selection of the design process stages depends on the selection criteria and is subject to change and these strategies can be selected in the design process according to the needs and requirements.

However, the revival of the industrial heritage is also conducive to the improvement of environmental, economic and social life, and make the protection and development of cultural heritage possible and now, with the co-integration of the three axes are provided which are included economy, culture-community, environment, economic sustainability, with the aim of escaping from poverty and building depreciation and economic efficiency, by restoring environmental vitality, participation and individual interactions leads to social sustainability, in the course of this revision, the rehabilitation and protection of the environment and the heritage site will have environmental sustainability. According to what was said, the main motive for writing this article is the introduction of strategic components of industrial heritage obsolete, which, in the current state of the industrial heritage, provides an assignment that can lead to the revival of this heritage by appropriate allocation. In this study, seven types of industrial heritage rehabilitation that have been redeployed using existing potential to meet urban needs have been studied in four industrial heritage sites in Iran and finally, by comparing the sustainability indices in the studied samples, the maximum relationship of each of the buildings with the sustainability regression criteria is investigated and analyzed. The conceptual model of the article is based on the research method, analytical-descriptive, so that the models of the case study, the applied model, are evaluated and the principles for reviving the industrial architecture's heritage are presented.

	<abstract language="eng">In this essay, due to the early establishment of the Qajar era transfering the new types of the representation of architecture, as well as the great interest of the Qajar kings and courtiers to the problem of the image, the significance of this period in the changes in the representation of Iranian architecture has doubled and the direction of research tends towards the factors of the formation and growth of this kind of representation. The aim of this research is to investigate the representations of Qajar architecture and recognize their characteristics during this period, given its importance to the problem of image. Considering the beginning and growth of visual language in the Qajar architecture, especially since the Nasseri's time, the hypothesis of the formation of a new representation and the change of explicit and implicit meanings of previous representations in this paper is measured and the main question is: In the representation of Qajar architecture, and in the course of changing the architecture of this era, how are new visual expression techniques in architecture affecting the representation of architecture and what are their basic characteristics? In order to accurately answer this question, based on the implicit and implicit meaning of the semiotics of architecture, Edward T. Hall&amp;rsquo;s underlying theory is used in which he interprets the topics in his anthropological domain attempting to establish a logical relationship between the change in the architectural space with its denotations and connotations through its representation and concepts like proxemics and distance are used for this purpose to approach the answer of the questions and the research. For this reason, using a mixed-qualitative research method, using a constructive-interpretive approach, an explanation of the response to these pressures has been addressed trying to get the result close to the hypothesis. In the final section, we try to find in three examples of three different periods in the Qajar dynasty and make these changes known as cases and compare them to the underlying theory of the paper.

	<abstract language="eng">Qajar architecture is a turning point in ideals and values as well as the field of diversity and contrasts in Iranian architecture and urban planning methods and tendencies. This turning point, concurrent with the gradual fade of basics of previous social identity such as ethnicity, religion, language, etc. and its movement towards concepts such as the superordinate (elites) and subordinates (people) became an outstanding instance in residential architecture in such a way that it changed the traditional homogenous and monolith structure of neighborhoods with the challenges between tradition and modernity and the use of the instrument of class differences and distinctions. The present study, conducted via a descriptive-analytical method on some case traditional and western mansions of the Qajar era, is to extract and explain characteristics of tradition and modernity in residential architecture of that era. Findings of the study show that the Qajar residential architecture passed a very tremendous and fast transformation in its passage from the traditional to the western world and regardless of no transformation in the building technology, by establishment of extroversion instead of introversion, formal and spatial changes in the circulation system, and direct modeling of elements and decorations of western architecture. However, no significant dynamics in line with utilization and completion of genuine and historical achievements of Iranian traditional architecture caused that that transformation became the field of contradictions and contrasts in Iranian residential architecture.

	<abstract language="eng">Today, cultural alienation and the influx of one-dimensional and purely human-centered materialistic ideology of the West have challenged Muslim communities' beliefs, values and religious and spiritual thinking. Indeed propaganda, invasion and the spread of ideas of wealth accumulation, materialism, promiscuity, etc., are undermining the foundations of culture, faith and religious in these communities and in the long run, will cause the loss of cultural and social, religious and political identity. In these times and situations one is reminded again of what Martin Heidegger, the German intellectual, once said: Now only divinity can save us. Therefore, to fight back against the massive invasion targeted at the cultural foundations of the of pure Islamic spiritual beliefs, the use of rational thinking and reasoning to respond to and promote Islamic and divine beliefs, thoughts, wisdom and values seem imperative. This issue is within the domain of Islamic philosophy and since it guides the man towards the source of all life through wisdom and rational thinking and strives to eradicate doubt and uncertainty about the sacredness of religion, it is deemed a divine philosophy. But the divine-Islamic ideology and philosophy should not be provided only in limited fields and trends and through complicated means of presentation. The use of various methods, tools and techniques compatible with the spirit and human nature, on the basis of rational reasoning can advance the field of noble goals of Islamic philosophy, which is to create a unity between revelation and reason. It seems that art and architecture, as one of its branches, has always had a prominent place in promoting the spiritual and Islamic beliefs, on the basis of reasoning and in a manner consistent with human nature. Sacred and exalted art is the result of revelation of artist who tries to show modality of universe ultra with using symbolic expression and main resource of Islamic philosophy (manifested of God). It is clear that, sacred architecture is the best effect of sacred art that releases human spirits from mortal world and guides them to eternal world. It should be mention that, non- identity of current human is caused by the lack of understanding and esoteric intuition and creating mortal works that dispossess human from reaching God. Therefore, this research believes that revitalization of sacred principles and use of Islamic philosophy resource cause restoration of human identity. So, this manuscript used analytic- descriptive method and comparative method and reviewing literature and resource technique, reviewing visual documentation technique, interview technique and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to explain ideas, rules and principles that form and determine impacts of Islamic philosophy in Formation of Exalted Art and Architecture in Urban Environment. Also in this research, to explain the relation between Islamic philosophy spirit and spirit of sacred art and architecture, transcendental ideas of Mosque designing such as Goharshd Mosque and Jame Mosque of Isfahan have been reviewed. Results of this research indicate that climbing; balance; centralist; respect to environment; unity; simplicity; rhythm and repetition; sense of discovery; order; variety (colors, forms, functions, patterns and characters); and innovation are principles that provide the best field for symbolic expression of sacred elements in the physical forms.&amp;nbsp;

	<abstract language="eng">Abstract
In architecture of the Islamic era of Iran, the architect has always tried to decorate the interior and exterior in different ways. According to Islamic scholars, Islamic art and traditionalist Islamic art has two separate concepts. Islamic art is decorated in Islamic art and architecture and is designed and presented to express the concepts of Qom. The study of traditional plant designs (Islamic and Khatai) and its existential causes in Islamic art, the widespread use of geometry and line in Islamic art, and the lack of use of animal designs in religious spaces make traditionalist views more desirable. Perhaps the ultimate goal of Iranian art is to build and decorate mosques. In the period of the Ilkhanis, the main problem was the consolidation and combination of building and decorative forms. This article examines the decorations and embellishments of the Ilkhani monuments in a comparative and qualitative way. The importance of the subject of research is that recognizing the principles of geometry and its relation to the philosophical infrastructure leads to an increase in the amount of motifs and patterns taken in the designs. The statistical population selected in this research includes two monuments of the Ilkhani period, which are: 1. Soltanieh Dome and 2. Tabriz Mosque. In the course of the Ilkhani, geometric patterns are more regular and it is considered as an important decorative pattern, and even it can be said that the sanctity of the buildings is increased with respect to the names of the buildings in comparison with the earlier periods. In the study of the decorative designs, we find interesting points. The buildings were decorated with motifs of Allah, Ali, Mohammad, and their use in different parts of the building was proportional to their greatness and importance.

	<abstract language="eng">This article studies the relationship between natural factors on location identity in Yasouj city. Natural factors have played a significant role in the life of Iranians and have a significant impact on Iranian identity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of natural factors on location identity and with respect to natural elements in Yasuj city. Since one of the most fundamental factors for human authentication is its relationship with its constructs and its cultural, natural and physical components, any transformation in these components will be a factor in the transformation of its identity. This research is aimed at better understanding and better understanding of natural elements in urban landscape. In this regard, spatial identity and its relation with elements of natural elements are measured. For this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared and a researcher made a questionnaire to measure the natural factors and based on the theoretical framework based on Saifuddini's theory. The questionnaires were distributed randomly among citizens of Yasouj, and the research tools were analyzed by analyzing the results of the questionnaire by inferential Pearson correlation. The results are analyzed in two descriptive and inferential levels. In the inferential case, Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression were used to test the hypothesis in order to test the research hypotheses. In this study, the results indicate a positive relationship between spatial identity and natural factors. The results showed that natural factors played an important role in Yasuj's prospect and also increased spatial identity. It can be inferred that the growth of the environment and its delivery to the quality level of the personality or identity of the individual and society will grow.

	<abstract language="eng">Abstract
Literary work has always been the focal point of reflection of cities and outer space. In the present century, with regard to issues such as war, colonialism, the destruction of urban spaces and many other factors, the city as the main pillar of the biological environment is the focus. Each author, in his own way, has created real and sometimes imaginative images of cities in his own way. Among the writers who describe the places and cities, Sohrab Sepehri, the poet and painter who is dominant, is a clear example. The interaction of literature and space has led to the formation of a new geographical critique. In geographical critique, according to the principle of referral, literary work is interacting with the outside world. The effect of the external world is not one-sided literary, but a mutual and dynamic effect. Thus, not only the outside world influences literary affairs, but literary work also gives a picture of the real and the external realm. In other words, literary influence affects the mutual understanding of outer space. In this article, we try to investigate city and place in poetry of Sohrab Sepehri. Also, it will try to use geographic criticism as a new research method in the study of urban spaces, to influence the city on Sohrab poetry and how the city is represented in literary form. Finally, this general question will be answered. What is meant by the interaction of the city and poetry with Sohrab Sepehri.

	<abstract language="eng">The key to the success of advanced industrial countries is to take advantage of the findings and principles of psychology in the work. The nature and purpose of industrial psychology - an organization and, more broadly, the psychology of work which will increase the efficiency of the organization's human resources by recognizing the causes of human behavior in work and providing useful scientific and useful solutions. Following this, the use of efficient and effective teachers is one of the topics that should be considered in any education system to create a climate in the school environment which, along with the development of efficient and effective students, can also improve the quality of job performance in teachers. One of the most fundamental problems in each country is country's human capital. Teachers and students are among the main assets that can play important role in scientific, cultural, social advancement of country. This study examined effectiveness of self-efficacy group training on professional dysfunctional beliefs, job satisfaction and job performance of teachers of Torbat-e Jam.The results showed that efficacy in experimental group dysfunctional beliefs professional training, components of job satisfaction and job performance had positive effect and promote them as well as results of analysis of covariance showed a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in post-test and test group at (p&lt;0.05).After a two-month follow-up results show sustainable results in intervention group. There were some issues such as the lack of a prevailing research morale among employees, and the novelty of the variables studied, especially self-efficacy and ineffective professional beliefs, and lack of access to broad theoretical foundations. The sample of this study has been selected among teachers of Torbat-e-Jam city and the generalization of the results of this research to other societies should be done with good faith. In spite of the above limitations, a new, excellent and growing new field of study has been launched. Regarding the results of this study, it can be suggested that, given the effectiveness of self-efficacy training on the effectiveness of professional self-efficacy, it can be used as one of the most effective cognitive interventions in field of job counseling.Also, given high unemployment rates and the lack of job-related expertise in most workers, it is suggested that such research be carried out on people who are on the verge of recruiting, which, in fact, can add to the richness of the next research, as well as the relationship between each Accountability components are explicitly investigated with job performance, job stress and political skills.

	<abstract language="eng">The architecture of the Esfahan House of Homes during the first Pahlavi period is very important due to the transition from traditional to western architecture. The structure of the plan in the buildings of this period has been changed and can be seen different views in the residential architecture of this period. One of these views is the theory of Gestalt psychology. Its analysis can reveal the structure of the structure of the buildings based on a particular theory. Gestalt's rules directly influence the placement of spaces, their perimeter shape and their dimensions, the proportion of empty and empty space, and the type of space composition. Other scholars have looked at the structure of the Pahlavi plan's plans from the social, historical and decorative point of view, but in terms of its form, the structure of the body has not been studied in the form of Gestalt theory. This article, with a new approach, analyzes the Gestalt rules for the first time on the structure of the Pahlavi House of Isfahan House plan. The data of this research are gathered in a library, field study and interview with traditional professors. This paper attempts to analyze the impact of Gestalt's rules on the Pahlavi House of Artists (Mohtashmi) through modeling and analyzing data. In this research, the structure of the first Pahlavi monument plan, the Gestalt theory and the existing laws are discussed. Then, the model of the study is modeled and finally the extent of the existence or absence of these rules on the structure of the house has been analyzed. The performed studies reveal the principles and rules of Gestalt psychology in the manner of placing spaces. The shape of the perimeter and their dimensions have been used relative to the vacancy of the spaces and its composition in the plans of the first Pahlavi houses in Isfahan.
