	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Identity crisis in today's architecture has become the concern of the scholars due to its compliance with modernity, inattention to humans' differences and variety in conditions and contexts for creating architecture works as well as its emphasis on the constant preset patterns. In such circumstances, &amp;quot;Iranian-Islamic architecture pattern&amp;quot; has been introduced by several scholars as a solution for reviving the historical and religious identity to architecture and complying it with the related fields. In this regard, the identification of key factors influencing the components of this pattern can affect the definition of this issue. Therefore, this article tries to introduce the components of Islamic-Iranian architecture and determine the consistency of these components with educational content of architecture (particularly, at B.A level). This study has employed a qualitative approach, determined the components of Islamic-Iranian architecture and the consistency of the content of architecture with that components through the simulation research method. The findings show that in the current program of architectural education, the share of training the Islamic principles, personal and social values and contexts is very low compared to the share of training the architecture tools. On the other hand, architectural education has mostly emphasized teaching the architectural tools rather than the fundamentals, which prevents the architecture students to form a holistic insight into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
