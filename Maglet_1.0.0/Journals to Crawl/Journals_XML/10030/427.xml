This article intends to examine the processes of change in poetic images from simplicity to exaggeration. In so doing, the author , upon meticulous examination of the old sources, discusses the occupation of the society's mentality in Saadi's well-known poem KAZ SANG NALE KHIZAD ROOZ-E VEDA-E YARAN (The stone will moan upon the friends' farewell) and presents the evolutionary process of a poetic image across time. Perhaps, the earliest mental script of the Iranian society for FARYAD AZ JODAEI (yelling out at separation) should be traced back in an ancient proverb of the Sasanids age which associates the concept with tearing the canvas dress. This image has been recorded in literary and poetic texts of the fourth century. Several years later, the poets implied the same sense through the image of breaking the wood. Eventually, Saadi exaggerates the image and expresses it through stone's moaning.

Economic evaluation of various societies is a way to better understand the governments and people's life. A review of the economic system of societies in the very far past- through their famous literature records- will reveal their industry, sub-divisions and active associations in the related fields, and also some hidden layers of their past. This paper considers environmental and meteorological conditions of Shahname and tribe battles, along with the necessity of governmental attention to people's life, to discuss activities such as agriculture, veterinary, weaving, blacksmithing, shipbuilding, and their rate of development.

Sadi is one of the few Persian poets whose fame and eternal presence in the Persian culture rests mostly on the effect of his works. This study is an effort to investigate the relationship between his didactic, rhetorical, religious and ethical poems and the principles of the Ash'ari school of rhetorical thought. To this end, we will define the discipline of rhetoric and mention its characteristic features as well as the reasons for its emergence and development, and also the probable weaknesses and failure of the Mo'tazele and Ashare. The two dominant schools of rhetoric in the Islamic civilization will be given special treatment. However, in the final section of the project, entitled &#34;Sa'di's school of Rhetoric&#34; the historical background and the reasons for Sa'dis tendency toward Ash'ari school will be explained.&#160; Finally evidence for this tendency and reflections of his Ash'ari thought samples will be extracted from his poems and will be classified and explained under the common rhetorical topics such as &#34;divine sight&#34;, &#34;divine justice&#34;, and &#34;determinism and free will

Varaqeh-o- Golshah is a beautiful and charming story, which Ayyuqi has put into verse.

The analysis of the components and the elements composing a story paves the way for the story to be known much better and reveals its merits and demerits. We have, therefore, had a structuralist look at the plot of the story as one of its basic elements.

In the story Varaqeh, the protagonist, aims at marrying Golshah. To this end he faces the resistance of the opponent forces; so the conditions of his own balanced life and those of his tribe are disturbed. But later on the protagonist succeeds to overcome his opponents with the helpful forces and achieves his aim. He also succeeds to restore the balanced and organized conditions &#8211; which are the result of the story&#8217;s events &#8211; to his life and that of his tribe.

The events that happen in the story form four Sequences in its plot. In this writing, as mentioned, the plots of the story and its consisting components have been analyzed from the viewpoint of structuralism.

This study explores dialogue, a dominant style in both traditional and contemporary poetry / prose&#160; narrative literature, in Shahname as a classical&#160; masterpiece. To this end, initially, the concept and terminology of dialogue is scrutinized from the viewpoint of narration and its position and functions are discussed. Then, a reasonably large number of various dialogues are extracted from Shahname and examined in terms of their different features, including their in/directness and the partners. Finally, to analyze the role of this literary element, a subset of the distinguished dialogues basically concerned with champions are analyzed further for their content and topic and how they correspond with the conditions and setting factors. It is concluded that the literary element under study is basically represented in the heroic section and the dominant theme is boastfulness.

Maolavi known as Rumi, in a lyrical poem discussed in this essay, expresses some of his mystical points of view, not explicitly, but through the poem&#8217;s structure. This poem has an organic form and in its structure there is a sign that indicates &#34;wind&#34; in its own absence has become a symbol. This poem because of its special structure can show a part of stylistic distinctness of Rumi in poetry.

Revival of written works in a society is a way for a better understanding of the society&#8217;s culture and civilization. The knowledge of criticism and correction of the texts helps to study the past written works by removing the dust of distortion and time that sits on such works. Saeed Nafisi is a researcher who has entered into this area and corrected some texts in a critical manner for the first time. Most of his efforts were concentrated on reviving verse type texts.

Considering the criteria required in correcting texts, this paper has dealt with his critical methods and views by studying 10 texts corrected by him, including 6 verse type works (Divan-e Anvari, Divan-e Attar, Divan-e Amaaq, Divan-e Rashidoddin-e Vatvat, Robaiyate Baba Afzal, Kkoliat-e Araqi) and four prose type works (Tarikh-e Beyhaqi, Goshayesh and Rahayesh, Lobab-al Albab, Reslaeye Fereydone Sepahsalar).

In the present paper, the analysis of the background and sociological reasons of the defeat of the Sasanian 's emperor&#160; has been examined by Ferdowsi's Shahname. Some of these factors have been pointed out by historiographers, like war for power by the Sasanian 's emperor. But Ferdowsi has new viewpoints about these problems like women&#8217;s reign. Some of the reasons have been recognized by Ferdowsi like national origin and women's reign. Although the selection of the starting point of the discussion very difficult but for some reasons, which are mentioned in the text of the research, Khosrow Parviz's reign is the starting point of this discussion.
