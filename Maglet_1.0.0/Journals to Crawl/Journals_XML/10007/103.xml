Based on this strategic orientation of organization on human resources management system has been investigated considering the mediating role of competence approach in Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In order to implement and test assumed model, researcher has proposed clear and measurable indicators for each one of research&amp;rsquos concepts and in order to determine the best indices of research through Delphi method and expertise inventory, 30 professors and experts of management and central bank managers were asked about items. Data collection was done based on an inventory with 109 questions and distributing it among random sample of 330 managers and central bank staffs. Analyzing data was accomplished through structural equation modeling and Lisrel software in two sections of measurement and structure. In section of measurement model, technical feature of inventory was investigated and necessary reforms were applied and in structural section, model&amp;rsquos structural coefficients were used for investigating research hypotheses. The results of research show significant and positive effect of mediating variable of competence approach on relationship between organization&amp;rsquos strategic orientation and human resource management. Based on research results by using efficiency strategy in organization and the mediating role of job-oriented competence approach, traditional human resources management is recommended. Effectiveness strategy has a significant relationship in the effect of future-orientation approach mediating role with strategic human resources management and with selecting creativity strategy and the mediating role of individual-orientation approach competence-oriented human resources management is suggested. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
