			The maturity of Human capital, its impact on performance and organization strategy, and how to assess this concept has been concerned by researchers in recent decades. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the level of human capital maturity in Iran's top 80 manufacturing organizations and to identify the strategic implications for it. For this purpose, Confirmatory Factor Analysis Method, Surveying through the human capital maturity questionnaire and network analysis method has been used. The results of the first method validated the questionnaire's variables, and in a sample of 80 among human resource managers in sample organizations, the questionnaire assessed the level of the human capital maturity as low (the score was almost 54) and finally based on the opinions of 10 human resource experts, the network analysis method prioritized factors affecting human capital maturity in this way: 1-The capacity of Learning capacity, 2-workforce optimization, 3-Knowledge accessibility, 4-Employee engagement, 5-Leadership practices. At last, based on opinions of 10 HRM and strategic management experts, and scores of these organizations, the defensive strategy was suggested based on typology of strategies according miles and snow.

The existence of transformative leaders who are able to create an atmosphere of trust and rearrange the organizational culture in order to foster organizational citizenship behaviors which in turn can encourage the employees to willingly share knowledge within the organization is valuable in any organization. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of transformational leadership in knowledge sharing among the employees of the National Iranian South Oil Company with a mediating role of organizational trust and organizational citizen behavior. The research method was descriptive-correlational. The statistical population of this research was composed of 1500 people who were the staff of the organization. 306 employees were chosen as the statistical sample using the Cochran formula. A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data. The reliability of the questionnaire was checked and verified using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The data was analyzed using SPSS-25 software for the inferential part and LISREL8.8 software was used to fit the path. The results of the research showed that organizational trust and organizational citizenship behavior played a mediating role in transformational leadership relationships and knowledge sharing.

			<abstract>
			The purpose of this study was to develop a model of alignment of HR strategies with macro-level strategies. The population of the research were directors and human resources experts of the National Iranian Oil Company and its subsidiaries. The sample needed for qualitative interviews to the extent of theoretical saturation and collected through a targeted judgment sampling of 14 people. Data analysis was done with grounded theory. Among the 272 meaningful statements obtained from the interviews, 329 codes were extracted, eliminating repetitive cases of 188 subcategories and 33 axial categories, including 4 categories of causal conditions, 6 categories of underlying conditions, 7 categories of strategies, 5 categories of intervening conditions, 5 categories of alignment phenomenon, and 6 categories of the alignment outcomes. It was found that the alignment of human resources strategies with the macro strategies of the National Iranian Oil Company included the strategic alignment from top to bottom, from bottom to top, internal alignment, organizational alignment, environmental alignment, and alignment between the company's human resources sub-systems with subsidiaries.

			<abstract>
			The research purpose was to identifying a model of factors affecting human resource outsourcing (HRO) in Maroon Petrochemical Company. The research is considered practical in terms of purpose and descriptive-exploratory based on mixed method, in terms of data collection. The statistical population was experts and experts of Maroon petrochemical company in the field of human resources. The number of these people was reported 15. For data analysis, interpretive-structural modeling was used. The results showed that the variables of increasing flexibility, decreasing organizational costs and improving creativity have an independent role in the model and on the intermediary and dependent variables of the model have a significant effect. The dependent variables of the model were: decrease of technology investment, gaining the good image and increasing security, in addition to the independent variables mentioned, influenced by the intermediary variables including factors product quality development, increasing the change need, increasing technological changes and the use of new technology, focusing more on core activities, achieving new capabilities, improving operational performance, using educational services, acquiring new experiences, providing new services, improving management, risk management and Agility organization.&#160;

			<abstract>
			This study aimed to explore the dimensions of emotional climate of organization in National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (NIOPDC). The statistical population consisted of all employees of NIOPDC in Khorasan Razavi District, and the sample was selected using purposeful sampling method up to the theoretical saturation with the sampling adequacy of 19 people. Data were collected through semi - structured interviews, and the analysis was done by qualitative content analysis. The findings showed that the dimensions of emotional climate of organization can be grouped into eight main dimensions including organizational hope climate, organizational trust climate, organizational fear climate, organizational anger climate, organizational love climate, organizational surprise climate, organizational happiness climate, and organizational security climate. Understanding these dimensions provides the basis for managing the emotional climate of organization in line with organizational goals.

			<abstract>
			&#160;The main purpose of this study was to provide a model for the expectations and priorities of human resources in National Iranian Oil Company by QFD for quality engineering of welfare system. The research method was qualitative and quantitative. At first, welfare indices were extracted from Delphi method and interviews with experts (n = 15) and then these indices were matched with the needs of human resources (n = 208) as a questionnaire. In the present study, the statistical sample in the qualitative section were the experts of the Oil Company's welfare department whose issues, such as time, availability of the interviewees, and the extent of their cooperation were considered. 15 people. After preparing the final questionnaire of expert indices in the quantitative part the number of questionnaires was obtained by Cochran formula. Reliability was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha of greater than 0.7 and validity test was performed by examining factor loadings and AVE scores. To ensure the quality of the home matrix (HOQ), technical requirements were created and the welfare service quality plans were processed to build the quality home matrix. In the final model it was found that the usability of internet services (GPS, virtual pages, online content, online information, etc.) is one of the key human resource expectations that influences other expectations. Also, the 18 components, depending on the type of relationship in their respective categories, have a positive or negative (strong and medium) impact on human resource expectations., have a positive or negative (strong and medium) impact on human resource expectations.&#160;The main purpose of this study was to provide a model for the expectations and priorities of human resources in National Iranian Oil Company by QFD for quality engineering of welfare system.

			This research aimed to determine the relationship between perceived organizational support (management support and organizational support), task interdependente and computer self-efficacy with behavioral intention to adopt e-learning system with the mediating role of individual norms in Isfahan Oil and Gas Pipeline Company. The research population was consisted of 250 employees and after the adoption and adaptation of the questionnaire, and using non-random sampling, 165 questionnaires were distributed and 150 usable questionnaires were returned. After the confirmation of validity and reliability, the data were analyzed by SPSS and SmartPLS. The results illustrated that the mediating role of individual norms in the relationship between organizational factors and task interdepenete with acceptance intention were supported while its mediation role between computer-self efficacy and acceptance intention was not statistically supported.
