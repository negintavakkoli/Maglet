Two types of fitness and alignment are essential in human resource management. Vertical alignment that points to the consistent of HRM strategies and activities with corporate strategies and goals and, horizontal alignment that is related to the consistency among various practices of human resource management. With regard to effective results and synergies resulting from consistent and integrated HR practices, identifying the dimensions of horizontal fitness in human resource management practices, providing a desirable and comprehensive model is inevitable. The present study was carried out for this purpose by using qualitative meta-analysis method. So that the most important definitions of the concept of alignment and horizontal alignment, as well as the models and theories related to it, have been identified and investigated. Then their strengths and weaknesses compared with each other and, finally, the proposed model was designed in such a way that includes a comprehensive definition of horizontal alignment and its effective dimensions. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it combines all definitions of the concept of alignment and horizontal alignment, and investigates horizontal integrity dimensions among human resource management practices, including process integrity, architectural and configuration integrity, and executive integrity in a comprehensive manner.

In many companies, the path from initiating creative ideas from individuals to innovate is not fully implemented for many reasons. Such companies have been convinced to use employees' new ideas effectively and know that will not happen except with a creative deviance. So, the goal of this research was to design a model of creative deviance in the National Iranian Oil Company using the grounded theory method as one of the qualitative methods.In this study, deep interviews were conducted with 11experts in the National Iranian Oil Company and University Professors , using theoretical sampling method for determining research sample. Then, the components of creative deviation were identified in three stages of coding in grounded theory method, including: open, axial, and selective coding methods. According to the results, management and organizational component (causal conditions), creative deviance (action/reaction strategy) characteristics of actors and features of the idea (context), managerial, organizational and biographical conditions (intervening conditions), positive and negative consequences in the individual and organizational levels (consequences) were extracted and creative deviance model was designed.

Since the improvement of human resource efficiency can play an effective role in the efficiency of organizations, it has always been one of the main research topics.The tendency to leave the organization is one of the factors affecting the efficiency of human capital, which can be predicted using in-data models, conditions governing the organization and the factors affecting it. For this purpose, intelligent algorithms based on neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm have been used in this research to predict the tendency to leave an organization. In this regard, a standard dataset was created based on a questionnaire of employees satisfaction and the desire to leave the job in the Karoon Oil and Gas Production Company. Then, using an artificial neural network as a classifier and a multi-objective genetic algorithm, the important factors or features were selected. In the next step, an expert system was proposed to select effective features. In order to test and evaluate the neural network algorithm developed with the standard data set, the necessary training was provided. The results showed that by using the proposed model, not only the willingness of employees to leave the organization can be predicted with more than 88% accuracy, but also, the key factors of leaving the organization can be determined.

One of the techniques used in management is the outsourcing of activities that are not necessarily associated with success due to the lack of proper selection of the contractor. Since this technique is implemented in a large part of the activities of the petroleum industry research center, this study addresses this issue. This research has been conducted with a applied-development approach, utilizing the expert group's view of mathematical modeling of selecting contractors at the oil industry research institute with the Bernardo model. The results showed that the research institute of petroleum industry in evaluating contractors should use a two-stage model. Also, from the viewpoint of the expert group in the first phase of selection, the number of selective criteria increases, the final utility rate is reduced in the expert group agreement, but this in the second phase of the selection reflects precisely the results of the photograph. Based on the results of this research, suggestions were managed to increase the satisfaction of contractors and stakeholders in this industry.
