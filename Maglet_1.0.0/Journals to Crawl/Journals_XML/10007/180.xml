						<title>Locating natural tourism areas based on principles of landscape architecture (Using a combination of focus group discussions and the Analytical Hierarchy Process)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=115&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Ecotourism is a sort of tourism that leaves the least deleterious effects on Environmental and Natural Resources. It contributes to preservation, survival, and continuation of species and natural habitats. It was introduced 1990 as an intermediary to sustainable development by NGOs, development experts and academic centers and has been studied ever since. In recent years this issue has attracted notable attention. Different organizations and at the head of them, the Cultural Heritage and Tourism organization has planed and constructed such sites in different regions and scales. Despite all these efforts, Sometimes selection of these sites is faced with challenge and need for smart and responsible choice is felt to meet the expectations of experts, officials and people. Now the question is: what criteria should be considered for locating sites with natural tourism potential? How can influence the importance of these criteria with respect to the available options in the final choice? This article will propose the systematic and accurate process for locating these sites with formation of the focus group discussion and composite it to analytical Hierarchy Process. Research method is Case study with making use of combinational strategies, and data collecting with field visits and the library methods. The research instrument is AHP plus Math-lab software with respect to the pervasive computations for forming the process. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

						<description>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A lot of different arguments have been done about urban historical texture in the literature of architecture and urbanism. Some considerations are done about urban historical texture in architecture and urbanism literature of IRAN up to now. However, they are scattered. Extent, variety and complexity of them have caused many difficulties in the Histology of the urban historic texture.For this purpose many studies in texture ground in different scientific. Theories, outlooks and conceptual framework of texture concept are considered. Many different observation and considerations were done from urban historical texture of Iran specific YAZD city. The elements, relationships, intermediates and etc, are explicated. These cases are collected and edited by descriptive-analytical method. Hierarchy model are made from them. Equivalent Counterpart elements and containing Counterpart elements are considered so that system and subsystem of the urban historical textures were explicated. In system theory base, the urban historical textures system was definite and was presented in model framework. It was used from induction and reduction cycle process and reverse. IT was edited detail to total after it was districted confidence results. Consequently this model can be highly recommended to use in Urbans historical texture. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=128&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Transport and urban traffic is one of the most essential problems facing the mega cities particularly in the developing countries like Iran. These problems often present themselves in the form of traffic congestion, lengthening of travel time, reduction of safety and increase in air pollution. Hence city managers were set to employ different methods to manage and control traffic. Establishing traffic control zone is one of the methods and policies used in some large city centers to reduce traffic flow. Recently with the decision of the State Traffic High Council it is expected that some major cities in Iran including Shiraz implement traffic control zone in near future. This article examines peoples’ opinion regarding implementation of traffic control zone in Shiraz. In this study effort has been focused first to the extent of popularity and support of people for traffic control zone and secondly identifying the influencing factors on it. Data for this study was collected through questionnaire specifically designed for this purpose from samples of residents and working people in Shiraz.  Even though several factors affect the results, this study shows that a high percentage of those questioned concurred with the implementation of this plan.</description>

						<title>Estimation of technical efficiency municipalities Iran case study: Municipal provincial centers nationwide</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=130&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>People in all ages and times have been faced with the problem of scared resources and facilities despite of the sciences and technologies they are still limited in resources. Therefore, organizations and institutions are forced to use their limited resources in the most efficient ways. In this study, the technical efficiencies of municipals in 30 provinces of Iran for the period of 2006-2008 is analyzed. The technical efficiency of each municipal is analyzed to subdivide the municipalities by efficiency. Holding the inputs total revenues, the number of personnel and area services constant the increase in the urban development costs is calculated applying a non-parametric method of DEA technical efficiency under fixed and variable returns to scale. The estimated results indicate that less than 50% of the municipals are surrounded with complete technical efficiencies and they may be used as a model for inefficient ones. Based on the method of variable returns to scale and the output- oriented the results also show that Ahvaz, Ilam, Kord, Qazvin, Tehran and Yasouj municipalities are a 100 percent efficient and they require no change in their inputs and outputs. On the other hand, Arak, Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Bojnourd, Bushehr, Gorgan, Hamadan, Kerman, Khorram Abad, Qum, Rasht, Sanandaj, Sari, Shiraz, Urmia, Zahedan and Zanjan municipalities are all inefficient and they have never reached a complete efficiency.</description>

						<title>Analyzing of Methods of Financing for Renewal Projects of Deteriorated Urban Textures (Case Study: Hamzehabad Neighborhood / Tehran)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=132&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Lack of required investments is one of the most important factors leading to increasing texture deterioration and renewal plans failure. This research evaluates different financing methods to renew deteriorated texture. Hamzehabad Neighborhood in district 20 of municipality of Tehran, in which revitalization and renewal plan is prepared, has been selected as the case study. Here, financing is a problem to execute the project. Regarding financing methods weaknesses and strengths, we should determine the effective selection criteria. In this research we evaluate 6 financing methods in order to renew this neighborhood. Participation, administrative convenience and efficiency are the three criteria according to which financing methods are evaluated. Freidman Test and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) have been applied to prioritize the methods on the basis of each index. Data are analyzed using SPSS and CAMFAR software. Results show that Hamzehabad inhabitant’s participation rate has been rather good. Joint venture method has the highest priority among financial resources methods. Bank loans, project shareholder, metric sale and participation bonds are placed, respectively, in the lower priorities. According to the urban manager’s view, the simplest method from execution point of view is metric sale and participation bonds and the others are in the lower priorities. It seems that here, Joint venture method with the highest IRR is the best financing method. Metric sale, BOT, civil participation, bank loans and project shareholder are placed in the lower rankings.</description>

						<title>Analysis and Evaluation of Sustainable Distribution and Development of Urban Green Spaces (Case Study: Miandoab City)</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=137&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>In the present era, the importance of green spaces in urban environments is to an extent that is considered as one of the sustainable development indicators. Physical and natural impacts of these spaces in urban systems and its various ecology, social, and economic efficiency in structure of society are irrefutable as this green space in cities and its per capita is considered the major issues in planning and urban management. Regarding the high environmental ability and privileged position of intersection, developing city of Miandoab, with a population of about 120 thousand people in South West Azerbaijan Province, has been faced with tremendous increasing of population and physical growth in the recent years. Consequences of such rapid growth can be seen in urban disproportionate physical development, urban environment gradual destruction, orchards and agricultural land use changes in surrounding of the cities. However, analysis and investigation of green space land use and its per capita in the Miandoab city with appropriate recommendations is important in order to balance the social and physical structure of cities. The present study, implemented with descriptive- analytical approach by using statistical data related to two different time periods in 1380 and 1390, shows that unlike national and international standards that provided for urban green space land use, despite the high environmental ability, the Miandoab city is facing a fundamental deficiency. Over the past decade, simultaneous to relative increase in the urban green space per capita, differences between regions in these spaces have been also dramatically increased and imbalances in the spatial distribution of urban parks became more intense. Finally, using an appropriate model and considering the abilities and environmental and social requirements for the city, appropriate per capita has been proposed as a case study.</description>

						<title>Assessing the social aftermaths of Tohid tunnel project in the city of Tehran</title>
						<link>http://ijurm.imo.org.ir/browse.php?a_id=142&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en</link>
						<description>Tohid tunnel has been built by Tehran’s municipality to decrease traffic (in 4 districts “2, 6, 10, 11”), environmental pollution and gas consumption of vehicles. Construction of this tunnel took 29 months, from Khordad 1386 to Bahman 1388. Construction process and after completion, the tunnel itself have had many positive and negative effects on target groups. Effects of the project have been assessed using 10 step ETA method and a method which is a combination of the quantitative (survey and survey journey, with 1420 person) and qualitative (280 in-depth interview with persons and groups) methods. Results are showing that during construction heavy traffic, economical damage, social problems, environmental pollution (dust, noise) and respiratory and mental problems have occurred extensively that caused problems for habitants of the areas, drivers and shop keepers of the area. When the tunnel has become available for use, it has had positive effects for people who live in northern and southern parts of the city but others who have had no access to the tunnel have not benefited from it. Researchers suggest that by constructing this tunnel, Tehran’s municipality increased social injustice instead of social justice. To compensate this social injustice there are some suggestions like developing green spaces, cutting off municipality tax, developing ways to access the tunnel, changing the ventilation system of the tunnel.</description>
