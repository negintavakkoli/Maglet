This was a descriptive-descriptive survey research using a semi-structured questionnaire and interview. In the first stage, an open questionnaire was prepared to identify the human capital development status in Iran Ministry of Petroleum of Iran. Then, a second questionnaire was designed to extract the relationships between variables, to determine the weighting coefficients of the indices and to present the mathematical model of the research.The statistical population was the experts from Ministry of Petroleum of Iran and based on the specific conditions, a number of its experts were selected as statistical sample. Systems dynamics approach was used to design the model. By using Vensim software, scenario writing was done. Finally, six scenarios were considered and among them &#34;Improvement of training and development software programs&#34; was identified as the strongest scenario and the &#34;Improvement of staffing capability&#34; was selected as the most attractive scenario. According to the results, the Ministry of Petroleum must first empower its staff to develop its human capital. Since empowerment is both objective and subjective, therefore, employees' mental capacity and self-esteem must be enhanced by increasing their skill level and empirical ability to achieve an acceptable level of productivity.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Nowadays, psychological traits of managers are among the factors that influence the success of organizations and are a key element of human resource empowerment. The current research aimed to identify psychological traits of Top managers in Oil fields of West Azerbaijan province which has been studied by the combined method (quantitative - qualitative). In the qualitative section, postmodern paradigm, phenomenological strategy, and latent content analysis technique by semi- structured (in-depth) interview (to the theoretical saturation level) with 16 cases of top managers and&#160; purposive sampling method was used for sampling and theoretical saturation was obtained from interviews with 10 individuals. In the quantitative section, using the structural equation modeling by partial least squares method, the reliability and validity of the obtained tool was confirmed. The interviews were analyzed through open coding and axial coding using MAXQDA12 and the Smart Pls2 software has been used to confirm the tool. The psychological Traits of Top Managers in the study community were identified in the four components of altruism, ambition, foresight and compatibility with others and a structural model based on these components was presented and the reliability and fit of the newly created model were evaluated.</Abstract>

Uncertainty in predicting competencies that are critical for companies and the inability to accurately estimate the voluntary of talents turnover, has required adapting concepts from the supply chain management, such as supply and strategic sourcing in talent management. The purpose of this research was to cluster the job occupations of the National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) in order to provide suitable strategies for sourcing talents in each cluster. This study is considered a quantitative applied research. The research strategy was c-means fuzzy clustering method. The statistical population was all human resources staff in NISOC and the statistical sample consisted of 80 experts from human resources section which have been selected by purposive method. Based on the findings, the job occupations were categorized into four clusters of routine, leverage, bottleneck and critical occupations, and suitable strategies for supplying and sourcing talents for each cluster were proposed.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The burnout issue of employees of the satellite staff is one of the most important issues in the management of human resources. Thus, the rate of employees' burnout in the Iranian Offshore Oil Company (Siri Operational Area) and the causes of its occurrence among the employees were discussed in this research Data gathering was done through a standard burnout questionnaire by Maslach and Jackson (1994) and the researcher-made questionnaire an occupational burnout in satellite jobs.The statistical sample consisted of 305 employees. Data were analyzed and evaluated by using Friedman variance analysis, Chi square test, Fisher test (ANOVA test) and Scheffe follow up test. The results of this study indicated that various causes among the five classes of occupational burnout etiology in the satellite careers affect its formation. Burnout of the company's staff is due to individual causes, occupational characteristics, organizational characteristics, and economic and social factors. Also, there was no confirmation of job burnout due to work environment factors.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The main purpose of this paper is to develop the model of work-life balance in Mazandaran Province Gas Company as a service and project-oriented company. In the present study, a qualitative method based on grounded theory strategy has been used, because the researcher has used systematically collected conceptual data to explain the model. The field method was used for data collection by interview tools and the statistical population consisted of 25 managers and experts of the study company. Researcher developed a credible theory of work-life balance using an inductive approach to data collection and for this purpose, after the open coding, concepts and categories were extracted and in the axial coding stage these categories were presented in the form of axial phenomena, causal conditions, contextual conditions, and confounding conditions. The story line and paradigm were then drawn.</Abstract>
