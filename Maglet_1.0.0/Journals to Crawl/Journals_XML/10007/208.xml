	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is to investigate in-store antecedents and consequences experiences on Hyperstar Stores. There were investigated purchase intention, store environment and characteristics of employees as antecedents affecting in-store experiences; while diversion purchasing and customer satisfaction were considered as its consequences. There were designed two studies to test hypotheses. The first study was quantitative approach of an experimental study. Its population included students of Islamic Azad University in Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz. The second study of quantitative approach in the current research is a descriptive-survey study. The variance analysis method was used to analyze the first study data. For this purpose, SPSS software was used in the first study. In the second study, PLS software and structural equation modeling method have been used. The results showed that experience-based purchase incentive affects affective and emotional experiences; and product-based purchase incentive affects cognitive experience. It was found that store lighting has more effects on emotional experience; and layout affects sensory and emotional experiences. It was also found that physical attractiveness and beaming employees influence all three types of in-store experiences, but staff helping affects emotional and cognitive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
