The performance assessment should be implemented with remarkable sensitivity due to the crucial role of job sensitivity that will be carried by the graduates from Imam Ali military university. Proposing and also designing a new model of performance assessment is of crucial significance due to the problems created by traditional models of performance assessment. In an attempt to propose a new model of performance assessment through utilizing 360 degree feedback, the precise indicators of performance assessment were explained and also identified at the early stage of investigation. Having identified the indicators and also adjusting it to statistical population, the indictors of performance assessment were emerged and then weighted as a result of administering a Likert questionnaire and also consulting with elites and experts. Thereupon, the weight and the significance of assessment resources were emerged as a result of paired test and AHP analysis. Moreover, fuzzy TOPSIS method was also run to rank the students of Imam Ali military university at the final stage of investigation. Greater exploitation of fuzzy data is due to the conceptual and intellectual inner nature of outcomes. Moreover, in terms of consistency of research purposes and statistical population, the study was conducted through utilizing purposive sampling method. In this study, the precise and the appropriate indicators of performance assessment were identified through proposing a comprehensive and multi-dimensional assessment system. The findings revealed that the indicators of performance assessment including identifying the students&#039; strength and weaknesses precisely and academically, identifying the problems and the obstacles ahead of education system as well as providing assistance in developing appropriate curriculum planning, participating the students in assessment process which contribute to the enhancement of their motivation and also improving their performance and finally reducing the fuzzy uncertainty about judgments and outcomes.</abstract>

			<abstract>The security of international borderlines among countries is identified as a crucial factor in providing national security. Among borderlands of Iran, in different historical junctures, the south of Khorasan province is always very prone to incidents and insecurity due to its geopolitical position. Moreover, this area is now threatened with numerous threats to national security including drug trafficking from Afghanistan to Iran, terrorist activities, the presence of extra-regional countries and forces in proximity of Iranian borderlines, the threat of ethnic and religious demands and illegal residence of people from some neighboring countries particularly Afghanistan. This study was an attempt to identify and also select appropriate sites of border military posts in Nehbandan- Afghanistan borderlines through relying on the capabilities of geomorphological units. This study was also aimed at enhancing the operational and defensive capabilities to fight against insurgents, drug trafficking and goods smuggling and also aimed at taking defensive measures on the borderlands. In terms of research data collection procedures, the study was conducted through utilizing the variety of geological maps, aerial photographs, satellite images as well as conceptual tools including software and models. Thereupon, area modeling were emerged as a result of utilizing fuzzy inference system and also investigating the factors including geomorphological units, geology, lithology, land utilities, easy access to the settlements, transportation routes, height, slope and finally drainage networks. The findings revealed that borderlands of Nehbandan are prone to penetrate. The findings also revealed that the drug trafficking, goods smuggling and insurgents’ penetration can be eradicated through suggestions including investigating the geological maps of military site selection, identifying the capabilities and limitations of geomorphological units in Nehbandan- Afghanistan borderlines, establishing 16 military posts on the borderlines and finally utilizing these units to fight against insurgents.</abstract>
