				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Understanding stock price behavior and price forecasting are one of the most challenging issues that speculators, traders and brokers are faced with. Since stock market was established in the nineteenth century, many researchers have focused on investigating the stock price forecasting model. At the outset some of the models such as Autoregressive, ARMA, ARIMA, ARCH and GARCH were widely applied. Although some of these models were better than others in performance, but none of them had satisfactory result. Recently a number of researchers have been considering the stock market as a dynamic nonlinear system. On the other hand, artificial intelligence techniques including neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic have produced successful results in solving complex problems. In this study we tried to use wavelet transform and neural network to present a model that more accurately predict the return on stock market index. In this hybrid model, the smoothing property of wavelet transform is used to reduce the noise level of data then a neural network model is used for forecasting. Comparison of forecast error in ARIMA models, neural network and wavelet neural network indicates that noise reduction improves forecasting of the index returns.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Trading strategies such as short sale and margin trading have an important and undeniable role in the development of capital markets in different countries. However, due to the structure of these contracts and existence of non-religious factors, using these trading strategies in Islamic stock markets has some difficulties. For this reason, financial researchers in these countries, along with Islamic scholars and by implementation of juridical trading strategies, have tried to benefit from aforementioned instruments for the development of capital markets. One of trading strategies that significantly contributes to market liquidity growth is short sale. However, contradiction of using this trading strategy with some principles of Islam has caused the Islamic finance scholars to design a suitable legal mechanism using Islamic contracts. In this paper, we first explain short selling and its benefits and damages. Then, using expertsâ opinions and TOPSIS method as well as regarding to legal, financial and juridical criteria adopted, we evaluate and prioritize Islamic alternatives to short selling and finally, we introduce the most proper approach for implementing it in Iranâs stock market.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In recent years, the relationship between performance and firm diversification become as an important empirical matter. The diversity strategies in companyâs business are able to affect the competitive balance of an industry. The aim of this study, investigate the effect of business diversification on performance and value of accepted firms in Tehranâs Stock Exchange. To achieve this goal, the Herfindahl-Hryshmn index and TobinQ index were used to assess the business diversification and the companyâs value from the market value in each year, respectively. This sample includes 125 accepted firms in Tehranâs stock exchange within 7 industries, in the periods of 1381-1390. In order to verify the hypothesis, a multiple regression based on panel data by Estimated Generalized Least Square (EGLS) was used. The results from the study hypothesis indicate that there is significant and direst relationship between Herfindahl _ Hryshmn index and the performance of studied firms in comparative industries, in semi concentrated industries, there is a negative relationship between Herfindahl _ Hryshmn index and the performance of studied firms, but not significant. Also there is a negative relationship between Herfindahl _ Hryshmn index and the value of studied firms in competitive, concentrated and semi-concentrated industries, but are not significant. In conclusion we can say that the business diversification have an significant and positive effect of performance and have non-significant and negative effects on value of studied firms.]]></dcterms:abstract>

Therefore the amount of cash holding in the firm must be optimized at the level itâs needed in the firm. Also result of managersâ performance must be disclosed in order to prevent misuse. This paper examines the impact of disclosure quality on the relationship between free cash flow and firm value. For this purpose, a sample of 70 firms listed in Tehran Stock Exchange during the years 1383 to 1389 were studied. The multivariate regression model was used to test the research hypotheses. The findings suggest that when the disclosure quality is high in a firm, and it has high growth opportunities, free cash flows have a strong and positive effect on the firm value.]]></dcterms:abstract>
