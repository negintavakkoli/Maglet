This research was designed to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between organizational silence and leadership style at Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). In this practical study, we gathered descriptive data by questionnaire, and utilized the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to look at the correlations among data points. The random sampling technique has been used to gather ۱۱۵ data points among the target population of ۳۵۰ employees at RIPI. It has been used a combination of Leadership Style questionnaire (Bass &amp; Avilio, ۲۰۰۰) , Personality questionnaire (L. R. Goldberg, ۱۹۹۳) , and Organizational Silence (M. Vakola and D. Bouradas, ۲۰۰۵) for gathering data. Reliability and validity of data were investigated by using the cronbach's alpha test and AVE test, respectively. The results indicated that the transformational and transactional leadership style has a significant reverse relationship with the organizational silence, while the relationship between non-interventional leadership style and organizational silence was insignificant. Furthermore, the introvert personality has a significant direct relationship with organizational silence. The results showed that for the staff with introvert personality, the non-interventional leadership style amplifies their silence and vice-versa. The personality variable in transformational and transactional leadership style has a moderating effect on the leadership-silence relationship as well.</field></doc></add>
