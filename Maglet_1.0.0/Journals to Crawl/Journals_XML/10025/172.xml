			<abstract> 
The present work that fits in the recently flourished field of Irano-Talmudica, examines a Talmudic narrative (Qiddushin 70a) that includes a number of foreign words (non-Aramaic/non-Hebrew). This work aims to investigate the aforementioned words and analyze them philologically in order to identify the language or languages that were common in Sasanian Mesopotamia. There are a number of Pahlavi (Middle Persian) words in the narrative as well, and it worth mentioning that in some cases various pronunciations of certain Pahlavi words are attested. In conclusion, the presence of a common language like present-day Farsi that contains words borrowed from Semitic languages, Greek, etc. is being suggested.</abstract>

			<abstract>Parthianswere Iranian kingswho ruled over this land for 475 years. Due to lack of sufficient written material from this era, coins are very useful resources for understanding the economic, cultural and artistic conditions of this period. By  studying on coins with Parthian script, we could analyze the development and change in this script. Most of the coins with Parthian Pahlavi scripts and silver Parthian drachmas belong to 51-228 AD that makes the examination of these drachms minted in Ecbatana more significant.
In this research we try to study the silver drachmas from Ecbatana which date from 51-228 AD, and examine the course of their evolution. This is possible by extracting Parthian script from the coins and then extracting all the characters of each coin and finally drawing up the timetable for changing characters. Silver drachmaswere the most prevalent coins and monetary units in the ancient world from the beginning of the 1st century AD, Ecbatana became the most important and sometimes the only city to mint drachmas. It is assumed that in the mint of Ecbatana, the engraver’s handwriting didn’t make a difference in different samples, which was confirmed by comparison of a number of coin samples in this study.</abstract>

			<abstract>Employing symbols in Persian poetry traces back to old times. The symbolic poems besides their apparent meaning, possess hidden meaning too. Therefore, from very beginning to divulge these hidden meanings, certain efforts have been made. Nima Youshij is one of the prominent contemporary poets who under the influence of French Poets has shown a special interest in symbol and symbolism. “It is night” is one of the symbolic poems belonging to the years after 1937, when he has tried to send his messages and express his ideas to special social groups, because of the social and political suffocating conditions of his time. Due to its structure and the symbols like “night”, “cloud”, “wind” and “air” which are established natural symbols in Nima’s poetry, this poem has produced a symbolic condition, so that the interpreters by the help of newly hermeneutics findings could discover its meaning.
In the present article, on the basis of the knowledge of hermeneutics, the writer has offered two possible hermeneutics views for the Nima’s “It Is Night”.</abstract>

			<abstract> 
The present research is a study of word order in a manichaean sogdian text, the story of two snakes. This story is a parable that shows manichaean beliefs and faiths. Selected structure to Word order analysis of this present research is Dryer`s BDT. Dryer to analysis Relationships between Verb patterners and object patterners, offers Branching Direction Theory (BDT). According to the BDT, the word order correlations reflect a tendency for languages to be consistently right-branching or consistently left-branching. To study of word order in the story of two snakes, 28 features are standardized according to Dryers`s pairs of elements and Dabir-Moghaddam`s 24 features. 378 pairs of elements are found in this text, 199 pairs elements are left-branching and 179 pairs elements are right-branching. So according to BDT the word order correlations of this text reflect tendency to left-branching more than another one.</abstract>

			<abstract>The sequence of story events is more or less reasonably foreseeable from its very immergence. Barely does a reader enter a story world, while precluding any short-term outlook. Whatever the readerly oriented horizons of expectations might be, they should nonetheless be textually legitimized through morphemics, which is an autotelic constituent analysis of a narrative text in order to deduce thematic components of the story behind it. Story reading, in this futuristic sense, can be defined as a function of some utopian hermeneutics, both arousing from the reader&#039;s perfigurated vision, and reconfiguring it at the same time. Inquiring into such a regressive progression along with morphemic analysis of a number of Persian modern sample stories, this article aims to explore the dialectics of reading.</abstract>

			<abstract>There are two main approaches to the predicative function of the adjectives that precede the verb ‘to be’ and it`s equivalences; one which considers these adjectives as a non-verbal element of the compound verb and the other one assumes them as the subject complement. Studying the behavior of the adjectives in the Persian Proposition Bank and Persian Syntactic Dependency Treebank show that the adjectives that accompany the verbs ‘to be’ and it`s equivalences are generally divided into two categories: 1- Adjectives that take argument structure and can be called adjective predicates; 2. Adjectives that do not take argument structure. This study assumes that only the second group of adjectives is the subject complement. To prove this claim, two substitution and coordination tests were used to identify whether this adjective is an autonomous constituent or a part of a whole. Also, considering the semantic role of the subject in the sentences containing this group of adjectives and based on the list of compound verbs in the Persian language, the hypothesis of this study was tested. Accordingly, about half of the approximately eleven thousand subject complements reported in the Persian Syntactic Dependency Treebank should be viewed as the non-verbal element of the-compound-verb.</abstract>

			<abstract>The present research deals with the comparative analysis of idiomatization, based on the influence of religious beliefs and signs in Spanish and Farsi, in the framework of anthropolinguistic approach. The cultural issues and the impact of culture on language are dominated in this approach.Since idioms are inseparable part of folk knowledge, and the religious beliefs are among the most influential cultural elements, the authors aimed at comparing 5o idioms based on religious beliefs and signs, in Spanish and Farsi in order to analyze the impact of the cultural issues on how native speakers of Spanish and Persian idiomatizea common concept. Research results show both difference and similarity in idiomatization based on religious beliefs and signs in Spanish and Farsi.As these two cultures are both conceived in religious contexts, they make use of religious beliefs and signs for idiomatization. However, since Spanish culture employs concepts of Catholicism and Persian culture employs concepts of Shii, the referents of these concepts are different across the two languages.</abstract>

			<abstract>The buried remains of the ruins of Sar-Mashhad represent a great city that belonged to the Sassanian-Islamic era. In 1979, Whitcomb succeeded in identifying the ruins of the ancient city ofGhandijan in the south of Kazeroon and the historic route of Shiraz to Tawwaj. Today, it is definitely clear that Ghandijan is the same as Sar-Mashhad, which is 84km. south of Kazeroon. Considering the remains of the ancient site, it seems that this city had thrived during the Sassanid era, at the beginning of the Islamic era, and during the second and third centuries, but was emptied during the seventh and eight centuries. The purpose of this article is to provide another interpretation of the mint mark GWDAN on a number of Arab-Sassanian coins dating back to the reign of Calipha Umar ibnUbayd Allah ibnM’mar.. However, if this mint mark instead signifies GNDAN, then it would correspond to the ancient city of Ghandijan according to linguistic and archaeological evidences, which is located in the Pars province near the city of Tawwaj.</abstract>

			<abstract>The narration collection which has been mentioned in Iranian national book is divided to the three main periods: myth, epic and historical.
