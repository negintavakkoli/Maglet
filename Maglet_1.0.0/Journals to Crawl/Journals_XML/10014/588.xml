title = {Identification of the factors related to transfer of training to work environment amongst the employees of National Petrochemical Company}, 
abstract ={Organizations have long been devoting significant financial resources to organizing organizational training. But the development of human resources is not achieved by conducting general and specialized training. Today, training is expected to provide the desired behavioral changes in the staff. Studies show that many educational programs do not create desirable behavioral changes in the staff. This means that employees are not able to transfer their learning to their work environment. The effectiveness of training is heavily reliant on the assumptions that occur in its transmission to the workplace. Therefore, one of the best ways to achieve educational effectiveness is to increase the transfer rate of education. Therefore, in this research, we have identified factors affecting the transfer of education. The research method was a survey and the statistical population included500 people who participated in the courses of Petrochemical Research and Technology Company in three cities of Tehran, Arak and Mahshahr. Among them, 217&#160; persons were selected through stratified random sampling method.&#160; In the research process, 27&#160; factors influencing the transfer of education were identified by reviewing the related literature. By implementing three stages of Delphi technique, these factors decreased to 18&#160; factors. Then, for identifying facilitating and preventing factors of transfer of training, a questionnaire was developed with 62&#160; items. The results showed that of among the 18&#160; identified factors, 7 factors were weak as facilitators, 9&#160; factors were considered as weak barriers, one factor as a strong barrier and one factor as a strong facilitator in this organization. Also, the results of exploratory factor analysis showed that the factors related to the transfer of training were grouped in five levels: individual, supportive, educational, reward system and progression, which resulted in the presentation of a new typology of factors influencing the transfer of training.},
