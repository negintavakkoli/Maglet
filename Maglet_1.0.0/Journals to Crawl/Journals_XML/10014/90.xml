<Abstract>Despite various developments in the public sector in recent years, low productivity of government agencies has been the main concern of Iranian policy makers. Employee silence and indifference towards the fate of an organization and its programs and lack of effective understanding between employees and management is an alarm of imminent reduction in organizational performance affecting the whole society at a macro level. This research attempts to provide a model to cover different dimensions of organizational silence. Organizational silence management is an important part of organizational behavior management which directly affects organizational decision-making. Survey research method and structural equation modeling were used and data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. The sample consisted of 354 male and female employees of the headquarters of the Iranian Social Security Organization. The questionnaire was designed on the basis of existing theories and using exploratory factor analysis method in 174 items. Using confirmatory factor analysis method, the components were confirmed and the final model was determined after confirmation of the components and sub-components. The final model offers a way to understand organizational silence and helps managers and policy makers reduce this phenomenon in their organization and create the spirit of work and effort among their staff. Managers can utilize this theory to eradicate organizational silence. This theory helps organization theorists achieve testable hypotheses in more comprehensive research.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Reduction of staffs&#8217; trust prevents them sharing their experience and knowledge to solve the issues in an organization and sharing their ideas to have desirable organizational changes. Thus, this research aimed at investigating the relationship between the employees&#8217; trust in managers and organizational silence. Indeed, in this research the effect of employees&#8217; perception of managers&#8217; character that according to Mayer et al, (1995) including: &#160;ability, benevolence and integrity, were studied on defensive and acquiescence silence. To cover this aim, the selected sample included 282 employees of central branch of National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company (N.I.O.P.D.C) and the required data was gathered by a questionnaire and analyzed by Structural Equations Methods.
Our study showed that increasing the trust of employees in managers reduces the organizational silence of staff. In addition, if the trust in managers increase, the defensive silence reduces, while acquiescence silence increases. According to the results, managers can improve their recognition of the silence environment in organizations which can lead to the change in behavior and increasing trust in managers resulting in not only creating positive employees' perception of managers&#8217; character but also, the willingness to share knowledge, experience and information. Finally, this can increase organizational performance.</Abstract>
