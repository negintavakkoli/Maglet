		<Abstract>Developing of mobile technologies in the field of health create a new branch of e-Health called mobile-health. The goal of this study is evaluation of communications infrastructure for mobile-health. For this purpose, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used for modeling and ranking the criterions and applications. Three main criteria in mobile communication network namely, data transmission, application services, and the accessing to the network were chosen. Then, sub-criteria of technological infrastructure were classified according to three main criteria using the Delphi and fuzzy Delphi techniques and thirteen applications for mobile-health was added to it as alternatives. The results show that the accessing to the mobile network has the highest weight (0.5656) and priority. The second criterion is data transmission (0.4184) and finally application services in mobile communication networks (0.0159) are the last factor. It has a large gap from other two factors. According to the obtained results, community mobilization, electronic health records of patient and patient monitoring have the highest weight 0.0981, 0.0878 and 0.0876, respectively, and these are the top priorities of mobile-health applications.</Abstract>
