Hence, it is crucial for the managers to identify the key organizational factors contributing to reduce work-related accidents. This study was conducted on 340 workers, employees, experts, supervisors, directors, and managers. The data evaluation involved a questionnaire while the analysis involved SPSS. Additionally, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis test were employed. With regard to the main criteria, the HR training procedure had the highest effect while the HR hiring procedure had the lowest effect on work-related accidents. Considering that HR training procedure has the greatest effect on reducing work-related accidents, it is critical to continuously optimize the training courses; There by to curb the major work-related accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
