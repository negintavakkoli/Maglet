Implicit theories of leadership as a series of cognitive structures that differentiate leaders from non-leaders have significant implications for followers as well as human resource management. In this regard, the present research attempted to identify and present the characteristics and capabilities of ideal leaders from the viewpoint of followers. Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews with 15 heads of units and employees of Iran's Oil Distribution Company in Kerman area. Exploratory blended research strategy was selected and used as a contractual content analysis tool. The texts of the interviews were compiled, had been written and coded, and then categories and themes were extracted; the results of coding and data analysis were classified into two themes of positive prototypes and negative prototypes. In the lowest level, 28 units of thoughts were discovered. Categories for positive pre-models include &#34;charismatic&#34;, &#34;humanistic&#34;, &#34;committed to securing,&#34; &#34;emotional maturity,&#34; &#34;high decision-making power,&#34; and for negative patterns of titles, &#34;self-protecting&#34;, &#34;deceitful&#34; and &#34;narrow&#34;. After the discovery of the categories of implied leadership theories in the qualitative stage, a quantitative validation of the model was developed and a 28-item questionnaire was designed and distributed among 128 samples under the supervision of units' heads, and the validity of the model was confirmed.

This study used a mixed method research (i.e. qualitative and quantitative methods). First, through the interviews with employees and using thematic analysis, the managers&#8217; behaviors were identified. Next, based on the identified behaviors and Kano model the type of each behavior was classified and according to this classification the managers&#8217; reverse behaviors were identified. Then the impact of managers&#8217; reverse behaviors on employees&#8217; organizational indifference was investigated by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS software. Based on the results of the interviews, 46 managers&#8217; behaviors were identified out of which ten behaviors were must-be; five behaviors were one-dimensional, eighteen behaviors were attractive and thirteen behaviors were reverse type. Also, the results showed that managers&#8217; reverse behaviors have a significant positive effect on organizational indifference (b=0.86).
