Nevertheless, the author of this article is trying to answer this question that what are legal basis and purposes of expropriation and limiting urban lands ownership? To answer this crucial question; we will initially explain the concept of expropriation and then, we will review principles and legal reasons for permission for this action by the government and then, we will explain the purposes of expropriation and limiting land ownership. Legal Principles of expropriation and limitation of ownership of urban lands by the government are cases such as special powers of the supreme Leader, private owners being bound to observe the legal criteria, preventing injurious to others in the exercise of the ownership right and the necessity of observing Islamic standards in financial and economic affairs. Objectives of expropriation and Limitation of Urban lands ownership by the government are items such as Public service, avoiding loss of others and issuing fines and penalties (financial punishment).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
