				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study investigated effective parameters in the leadership and management among commanders of the Army ground Force, hierarchy of each criterion and ultimately proposal of a desirable leadership and management model from the respective commanders and senior managers’ perspectives.
Characterized as an applied and field study, the research employed the participation of the 100 commanders and senior managers selected based on stratified sampling and given the sample size formula (i.e. 40 and 60 commanders and managers, respectively). A 140-item researcher-made questionnaire was sent to the participants in three phases as required by Delphi technique. Both factor analysis and Cronbach alpha correlational analysis were run to validate the instrument, revealing an index of .99. Furthermore, correlation of determining matrix showed different from. test result showed less than 0/0001 as significant level. Principal component (PC) analysis based on varimax rotation showed common factors correlating a lot built up a single trait. In general, FA revealed six factors including spiritual health (%51 of 33 factor loading), psychological health (%7.9 of 23 factor loading), professional capability (%3.2 of 35 factor loading), leadership capability (%2.2 of 21 factor loading), maturation (%1.8 of 11 factor loading) and general ability (%1.6 of 8 factor loading) altogether build up %68 of the common variance of the leadership and management. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In a bid to improve its educational system, Imam Ali Military University has put e-learning development and use in its priority list. Meanwhile, academics are believed to play a crucial role in shifting from traditional learning to e-learning; a motive behind investigating their prospective along with the respective limitations and motivators. As an exploratory and quantitative study, the research took the advantages of their contribution in answering two separate questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed based on ANOVA and rank distribution analysis. The findings revealed that wider use of computer and e-mail communications positively correlates with e-learning. Meanwhile, lower access to internet and high-speed internet network are identified as the most limiting and motivating factors, respectively.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Though teaching and learning associate two sides of one coin, each is assumed to be approached stylistically in different ways by teachers and learners as far as the issues of teaching and learning styles are concerned, respectively. In line with this perspective, this study is an inquiry into the extent to which language teachers and learners’ teaching-learning styles match or vary, particularly in the light of the educational setting (military vs. nonmilitary) in which they are involved. To this end, 32 EFL teachers and 72 learners doing their language teaching and learning careers from the two different EFL settings inIranwere selected. Each group received its respective questionnaire addressing teaching and learning styles. Cross comparative analysis of the data showed that neither teachers-teachers and learners-learners nor teachers-learners from both settings do recruit much different styles in the process of teaching and learning. It means that neither do the teachers’ teaching styles nor the learners’ learning styles differ to a great extent, if not completely match.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[To describe Fuzzy cognitive Map (FCM) as a facilitator of system decision-makings and analyses, this study addresses its application in security threats against states’ sovereignty, in particular that of Syria. Such threats against Syria, one of the key players in the region and the Islamic resistance battle front, are of crucial strategic significance. This study, in fact, simulates the interaction of effective operators in Syrian security threats, resistance and authority, which causes disorder and violence in various administrative cycles in an atmosphere of  confrontation and seditiousness of the western world led by the U.S.A and Zionist regime. A study like this deemed unavoidable and a determining requirement aiming to aid the leaders, politicians and authorities active in the field of defensive security among the independent states, specially within the defensive- security process of the resistance field. Those common decisions which could be made so easily in the past have now changed into multi-dimensional equations covering all areas of human security ranging from security to economy and culture. given the ambiguities and multiple variables involved, application of mathematical approaches and professional systems such as FCM could appear as an innovation to make the dull atmosphere transparent. That was why this study attempted to first describe the FCM methodology and second defect the parameters intensifying Syrian dilemma and then approach the latter through the former. To do so, certain possible scenarios leading to the respective consequences and the variables intensifying Syrian dilemma are forecast in which the variables are investigated based on panel of experts in a descriptive- field research design employing an FCM framework.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Nowadays, knowledge management (KM) as a strategic property is very common, having made KM particularly significant for many scholars. That is why many of the respective projects focus on improving its four cycle process. In line with this trend, this study concentrated on knowledge sharing as one of the cycles in Tarbiat Modarres University from which 171 staff members participated in the study. Employing regression and Pearson correletional analysis, the study revealed that tripartite dimensions of organizational confidence (i.e., capability: integrity and goodness) have positive effects on the tendency of staff members to share knowledge. The findings may also be generalisable to other universities including the military ones.]]></dcterms:abstract>

As an applied –descriptive research, this study was initiated with selecting certain proposed criteria leading to development of a questionnaire attempted by the sample population. The respective statistical analysis revealed identification of certain effective criteria in the evaluation process. Ultimately, the process led to proposing a model of evaluation accommodating three strategic, tactical and operational dimensions and then introducing readiness plans for the Iranian Military organizations to implement the system.]]></dcterms:abstract>
