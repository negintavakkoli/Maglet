<Abstract>According to the main role of culture as an affecting factor on organizational relationships and personnel performance, the purpose of this study has been analyzing organizational subcultures and rifts among them using a locally-developed model founded on work practices. To do this, first, the existence of functional and hierarchical subcultures was investigated and proved based on the researcher-developed model using Kruskal Wallis and Mann &#8211;Whitney U tests and then, cultural rifts among the subcultures were calculated. The analysis performed within SPSS on 255 responses to the research questionnaire in the central office of IOPTC. According to the results, the highest level of cultural rift among functional subcultures was in development dimension and its lowest level was in bureaucracy dimension. Also, the highest level of cultural rift among managers&#8217; and employees&#8217; subcultures was in participation dimension and its lowest level has been observed in stress dimension. Having knowledge about subcultures and rifts among them provides possibilities for correcting cultural practices for better organizational adaptation to environment, decreasing misunderstandings between subcultures especially between managers&#8217; and employees&#8217; subcultures and also, help managers to take more effective decisions.</Abstract>
