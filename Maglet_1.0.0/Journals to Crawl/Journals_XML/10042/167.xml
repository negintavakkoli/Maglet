title = {Applying New Approach to Develop a Strategy in Gold Industry (Case Study: Isfahan Urban Economy)}, 
abstract ={The production of gold ornaments and artifacts is a local and national industry. Isfahan is one of the major metropolises which it has the first rank of gold industry, jewelry and silver in Iran. Obtained value added in this industry is not in a good position than other industries in Isfahan, however. Thus, more attention to this valuable industry will result in more development and growth and economic progress in Isfahan as well. Hence, the researcher tried to present an integrated framework in order to develop appropriate strategies in this metropolis which will help the growth and survival of the industry. For presenting a comprehensive framework strategy, SWOT has been used for determining the factors in this study. Major factors have been selected by using fuzzy linguistic variables and multi criteria decision making method. Using these factors, necessary conditions for enhancing value added obtained from this industry may be enhanced and more share of global markets will be gained.},

abstract ={Mutual connection between the structure of cities and economic factors often leads to economic feedbacks which caused by structural intervention. This intervention usually affects people, private and public sectors&#8217; decisions in urban land use through reducing or increasing economic costs or benefits of urban activities. The purpose of this study is prediction the changes in housing prices after implementation of distressed areas&#8217; rehabilitation projects in (Majd project) (one of the rehabilitation projects of distressed areas in Mashhad) by using Grey Theory to predict the future price of real estates. The results showed that the prediction of economic and structural developments in studied area may result in the changes of real estate nominal prices, which can be explained by the Adaptive Expectations Theory in economics. Even though the structural effects are the first and more visible impacts of distressed areas rehabilitation projects, the subsequent economic effects would appear with some delays (4 years for this study). The real estate prices in two study areas - out of four &#8211; have been affected more than others. In 2013, the implementation of Majd project caused 27 to 54 percent increase in real prices of housing in that area. The results of the Grey Theory represented that current increasing trend in real estate prices will continue in future in a way that until to the project completion time, the nominal prices of real estate in that area would increase by 30 percent in comparison to 2013. Eventually, some recommendations such as reforming local prices offered to exploit the economic benefits of increased prices of real estate.},

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson correlation coefficient, sample T test, T statistics in SPSS and LISREL were used for data collection. Confirmatory Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling were used for studying construct validity of the questionnaire and testing the hypothesis and model fitting concept respectively. According to the obtained results, there is a positive and significant relationship between organizational learning and social accountability.

abstract ={Heterogeneity of distribution system of urban services is one of the most important consequences of the rapid growth of urbanization and physical development of cities in the country in the past decades. It has paved the way for social injustice and having urban services land uses in the regions and neighborhoods of a city. This research has been developed in order to measure access level of residents in urban areas of Zahedan for required facilities and services. Initially, per capita of status quo of each individual from service uses of city&#8217;s status quo was extracted by using data and information of Zahedan comprehensive urban plan and then the extent and distribution of land uses in five districts of Zahedan were&#160; examined by utilizing Williamson and entropy models. Finally, each district was evaluated and ranked in terms of having facilities and services. The results of Williamson and entropy models show unbalanced distribution and lack of services in district 4 due to large and increasing population. Balanced distribution of services is seen in district 5 and studying results of having urban services and facilities due to TOPSIS model shows that there is a big difference among urban areas in terms of accessibility and urban services so that the highest amount of TOPSIS for district 5 is 0.894 and the lowest amounts are 0.058 and 0.178 for districts 2 and 4 respectively.},

title = {Spatial Ranking of Public Services and their Shortage in Cities (Case Study: Noorabad Mamsani City)}, 
abstract ={One of the criteria of social justice and urban sustainable development is considering balanced distribution of infrastructures and urban facilities therefore, the distribution of the services should be in such a way that not only it creates spatial justice in the areas, but it also prepare the ground for urban development. This research has descriptive-analytical approach and tries to recognize and rank the rate of existing services in 13 neighborhoods of Noorabad Mamsani City in Fars Province using education, health, and cultur, sport, office, green space, and facility indexes. For this purpose, initially the prosperity of services in these areas was examined by using models of the coefficient of variation and statistical techniques and then, the rate of prosperity of urban services in these neighborhoods was evaluated and analyzed by using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model based on TOPSIS approach. The results show that there are significant discrepancies regarding the rate of prosperity of services among 13 neighborhoods of Noorabad so that central areas of the city i.e. neighborhoods 1 and 2 in district 2, are prosperous and nomadic areas are prosper less. Eventually, there is imbalance and inequality among different areas in this city regarding concentration of population and access in terms of spatial distribution of services.},

abstract ={Urban regeneration is a comprehensive plan preparing the ground for sustainable improvement in economic, physical, social, and environmental condition in a city. Locating urban regeneration projects is one of the most important steps of the plan. The result of the negligence is failure in the implementation of projects or the imposition of financial, social, and cultural damages to cities. The current study intends to verify the hypothesis that following complex, multi-dimensions, and particularly presented models in this paper are considerably more effective on locating projects through presenting an exact locating model and measuring its accuracy in the case study. 13 criteria and 32 sub-criteria of economic, social, physical, environmental, and administrative information have been simultaneously used in locating process in the proposed model. Compatibility Coefficient for the importance of options in AHP model has been calculated and verified by utilizing GIS instrument. Data were collected from the case study by field method to locate the projects. The results show that there is a direct and significant relation between the place of projects and socio-economic variables in the environment.},
