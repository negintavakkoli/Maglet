To this end, via survey method and researcher-developed questionnaire, the required data were collected from such three groups as group A, i. e. the owners whose property is out of texture (n= ۲۰۱) , group B, i. e. those who are transferring their property (n=۷۰) , and group C, other property owners (n=۱۷۰) and the collected date were statistically analyzed by means of the software Statistica ۸. The results obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that there is a proper linear link between the set of canonical variables. While in groups A and B, the index of texture unsustainability (X۱) with an amount equal to -۰٫۶۵ and in group C, the index of impassability (X۲) reduced with an amount equal to -۰٫۹۶, in group A, the household economic index (Y۳) , in group B, technical-structural index (Y۱) , and in group C, economic index (Y۳) increase to the amount ۰٫۵۹, ۰٫۷۷, and ۰٫۸۷, respectively. Therefore, the results show that the indices of texture identification, both sustainability- and impassability-wise, enjoy better concordance with the increase or decrease in the indices of economic and structural-technical sustainable development, and comparing with other canonical variables, play much more role in the first Canonical Correlation Coefficient, i. e. in the quality of urban sustainable development around the holy shrine. </field></doc></add>
