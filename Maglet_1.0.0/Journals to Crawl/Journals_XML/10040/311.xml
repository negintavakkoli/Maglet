			<abstract>In a world where change is the unchanged rule, generational changes are faster and the term &quot;generation&quot; has become a concept which is only used for a decade. Each generation has different lifestyles, their needs are different and they have other desires and wishes. From this perspective, the study of the characteristics and attitudes of a generations and intergenerational studies is essential for a better understanding of social behaviors and the way in which future social reality is constructed. The present study as a futuristic study explores the images of the future in the minds of female students born in the 1370s decade. The data of this research were obtained through semi-structured interviews and analyzed by qualitative methods of thematic analysis and narrative analysis.  The results of the research show that 8 macro narratives create images of the future in the minds of Interviewees. These macro narratives are as follows: 1. Small steps and gradual changes; 2. the transition from traditional to modern life; 3. Social without future; 4. my color; 5. Paradise Homeland; 6. Female participation; 7. future without gender and 8. Mother forever. Finally, the findings of this paper show that although interviewees, like most young people in the world, face two categories of social disappointment and individualism as negative images of the future; however, 3 narratives include future without gender, acceptance of the role of motherhood and a positive image of Iran&#039;s future reflects the constructive role of women born in the 70s in the future of the country.</abstract>

			<abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of social capital and economic factors on women&#039;s happiness. The statistical population of this research includes 18-65 year old women in Tehran. Sample size in this study, 384 people were selected using Cochran formula and the samples were selected using multistage cluster sampling method in 22 areas of Tehran. The data gathering tool was a modified standard Oxford Happiness Inverntory (OHI) test. Estimating the effect of variables on women&#039;s happiness has been done by using the software Eviews and estimate the cross-sectional regression by the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator. The results of regression analysis show that among economic variables, household income has a positive effect on women&#039;s happiness and is reliable . Research findings also show that social coherence, social participation, social trust as the variables studied in relation to social capital, have a meaningful and positive relationship with happiness. That is, with the rise of social capital in women, their happiness increases. In addition, studying the effect of education shows that this variable has a significant and inverse relationship with women&#039;s happiness. That is, with the increase in the level of education of women, their happiness levels are reduced.</abstract>

			<abstract>Women make up half of the country&#039;s educated population and have an important contribution to society&#039;s development. Due to the importance of science and technology in the country&#039;s development, policymakers have adopted policies for the participation of women in this area. However, so far, a model for evaluating these policies has not been presented. In this paper, first, by reviewing the subject literature and carrying out expert interviews, the dimensions and components of policy evaluation were considered and the initial model was proposed. This model was tested through a questionnaire using 43 female researchers and 36 policy makers. Accordingly, the final model consists of seven dimensions (policy objectives, policy assumptions, institutional matching, policy design, policy implementation, resource adequacy, and outcomes and outcomes), and a total of 15 components and 41 indicators. The research method is applied, cross-sectional, descriptive, survey and hybrid, which has been developed by generating distribution tables using SPSS. The results of the mean tests showed that the model was approved for both societies. Finally, based on this research, policy recommendations were presented.</abstract>

			<abstract>This research was conducted with the general purpose of investigating the effective constructs on improving the participation of rural women in promoting household food security. The statistical population of the study included all rural women in Tarom Olia (N = 10796) out of which 398 people were selected using Kerjeci and Morgan sampling table and stratified random sampling method was applied to select and interview the respondents. The main instrument of this study was a questionnaire. The validity of research instrument was confirmed by a panel of food safety experts and faculty members of the Department of Agricultural Management and Development of Tehran University and its reliability was confirmed by Cronbach&#039;s alpha coefficient. Data analysis was performed in two sections of descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSSwin18 and Lisrel8.54 software. The results of the study indicated the prevalence of poor food security status and low participation of rural women in promoting food security. The results of correlation analysis showed that economic, social and psychological constructs have a positive and significant relationship with the improvement of women&#039;s participation in promoting food security. In addition, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the (economic, social and psychological) constructs with a coefficient of 81% (γ = 0.99, t = 7.92) had a positive and significant effect on improving the participation of rural women in promotion Household food security</abstract>

In order to collect information, deep interviewing method with 28 knowledgeable experts in the field of empowerment of women in different institutions of the province was first used and qualitative information was collected and after qualitative analysis of the data by conceptualization and development method Classification and extraction of indicators (positive and negative effects), a researcher-made cross-sectional analysis matrix was designed. Triangulation method and documentary and library information, direct observation and deep interviewing were used to ensure the reliability of qualitative data. After the first and second phases, the designed questionnaires are provided to the experts and they examine the relationship between the variables in the cross-sectional matrix and the interrelationship between them. Micmac software has been used to analyze the data. The results showed that in the future, the most important positive indicators for the system analysis of the consequences of the traditional strategy of empowerment of female headed households were &quot;job creation&quot;, &quot;access to resources&quot;, &quot;increase in production&quot; and &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; and in the dimension Negative include the variables of &quot;waste on financial resources due to misuse of loans and microfinance&quot;, &quot;major attention (and merely) of institutions to pay loans&quot; and &quot;increased false consumerism&quot;.</abstract>
