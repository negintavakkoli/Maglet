	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;Due to universal importance of Tabriz carpet art and presence of specific indicators and motifs in Tabriz carpet art and its potentials, existence of architectural site for representing this art as carpet art museum in Tabriz is necessary. The site of this project is located adjacent to Tabriz Blue Mosque near the museum historical site. It is essential to consider the historical elements and components of the mentioned district identity in historical sites. This research aims at presenting architectural design of a valuable work of Tabriz carpet art museum besides considering criteria of the historical site adjacent to the Tabriz Blue Mosque. In designing Tabriz carpet art museum, the site potentials, concurrent employment of cultural and historical fabric concepts, adjacency of the Blue Mosque and being in direction of historical bazaar and Silk Road have been considered and used as the key pivots in design. This research is a case study based on observation and using architectural tools. Design limitations have been considered in the architecture of the museum near historical fabrics. The design components consist of Tabriz Bazaar cultural-historical architecture elements, utilization of the spatial connection, semantic continuation, respect to the site, preservation of old historical memory in modern approach. The results of this research can lead to successful architecture design adjacent to historical sites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
