			<abstract>The expansion of the acceptance zone is very important to military organizations, especially Imam Ali Military University as efficient scientific arm and higher education center of Ground Force of I.R.of Iran. Therefore, this study, aimed to identify the effective factors on employees&#039; acceptance zone expansion in Imam Ali Military University in Grounded Theory method and based on deep and semi-structured interviews with experts. The results of the research indicate, identifying commander&#039;s acceptability (with 6 components and 35 indicators), the readiness of the subordinates (with 5 components and 20 indicators), and the characteristics of the order (with 2 components and 9 indicators) as effective factors on acceptance zone expansion. On the other hand, 8 components of the strategies of the acceptance zone expansion which are influenced by organization and community characteristics were identified: eligibility, appropriate socialization, diverse relationships, job diversification, diversified rewards system, training, empowerment and management based on the goal. Imam Ali Military University can expand employees&#039; acceptance zone by identified HRM measurements.</abstract>

			<abstract>Today, a continuous and proper performance assessment is important to all stakeholders in an organization. Continuous improvement of performance will not be possible without examination and information about the extent to which the goals are met, and without identifying the challenges faced by the organization and gaining feedback from the extent to which compiled policies are implemented and identifying those areas that require serious improvement; and all of this is not possible without performance assessment. Based on the explanation of the concept of virtuous and jihadi organization, this type of organization has a fundamental principle that emphasizes spirituality and moral-Islamic-human values. Nowadays, with the advancements in management, the effect of spirituality on other components of virtuous organizations has been established; hence in this study, we seek to measure the effectiveness and prioritization of the components of virtuous and jihadi organizations. Through the method of Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, it is tried to rank the component of virtuous and jihadi organizations and assessed the performance of these types of organizations; then we obtained the importance of the components by placing the hierarchy of the components (predetermined) in the Analytic Hierarchy Process questionnaire (paired comparisons). Also, in another questionnaire, the experts were asked about the organization performance relative to all components. Finally, we presented a final assessment of the organization&#039;s performance. Among the macro criteria, &quot;flexibility&quot; has the highest priority and &quot;wisdom&quot; has the lowest priority. Also, among the minor criteria, &quot;the natural selection of the best person as the director&quot; has the highest priority and &quot;Women&#039;s employment in limited form and as needed&quot; has the lowest priority. In the main criteria, the organization has had the best and worst performance in terms of &quot;organizational brotherhood&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;, respectively. Also, in relation to sub-criteria, the organization has had the best and worst performance in &quot;fixing errors with humor and indirect&quot; and &quot;self-control&quot;, respectively.</abstract>

			<abstract>Knowing the elements and components of quality in any matter and achieving the exact definition of quality in it is one of the challenging factors in today&#039;s world. This challenge becomes more complex in the subjects of higher education, where the quality assessment is more ambiguous. This study aimed to identify the effective dimensions and components in the quality of the military higher education system. This descriptive-survey study is qualitative- quantitative in terms of data type. The statistical population in the qualitative section of the study, composed of 22 academic members of Shahid Sattari Aeronautical University, the researchers of the NAHAJA Strategic Study Office and the experts of the Education Deputy, and in the quantitative section, 226 members were selected from among the cadets  and graduates of the university based on combined sampling method (cluster-stratified). Data collected through the semi-structured interview and a reliable and valid (face, content and structure) researcher-made questionnaire as research instruments. The data were exposed to exploratory factor analysis to determine the dimensions and components of quality in military higher education system, and to present the final model of the research, structural equation modeling techniques were run by using the LISREL software. Main findings reveal that the effective dimensions and components in the quality of the military education system include two major academic and military dimensions.</abstract>

			<abstract>The recognition of physical fitness and functional capacity of military personnel is one of the important concerns of the armed forces of the country. This study aimed to compare the factors of physical fitness including flexibility, agility, speed, aerobic power, anaerobic power and explosive power among the graduates. For this purpose, 100 students selected from among athletes in Imam Ali University and Shahid Sattari Aeronautical University based on convenience sampling method. Then, all subjects were taken rast test, Sit and reach Hugo corrected test, 36m speed test, Sargent jump test, Illinois Test and Cooper test in three sessions in three days (one week between each session). To analyze the data, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first used to determine the normality of the data and the independent t-test was used to examine the differences between the two groups and the SPSS software (V. 22) was used. The results showed that there is a significant difference between the two universities in the speed variables (p = 0.0001), agility (p = 0.0001), explosive power (p = 0.0001), aerobic power (p = 0.0001) and anaerobic power (p = 0.0001). According to the results, it is concluded that physical fitness factors are different among the graduates of Imam Ali University and Shahid Sattari Aeronautical University.</abstract>

			<abstract>The Islamic Republic of Iran&#039;s Army provides many services through IT solutions, so proper management of these services is felt before deployment in the Army. ITIL is one of the most famous frameworks in realization of IT service management. This study aimed to find a model for the implementation of information and communication technology services in the Islamic Republic of Iran Army based on the ITIL model. This applied and mixed method study (qualitative-quantitative) has been performed in 3 stages. In the first stage, the initial conceptual model of research (consisting of 29 components) have been developed based on the documents, scientific articles and previous studies. Then, in the second stage, by conducting interviews with experts (Delphi method), the complementary model of research was compiled with 30 components, and in the third stage, for the quantitative validation of the proposed model, various statistical tests and confirmatory factor analysis method were used. Also, to confirm the hypotheses and the proposed model, structural equation modeling and Path Analysis methods are used via Smartpls3 software. The research pattern has been investigated based on different indices, after confirming the appropriateness of the coefficients (t-value). The evaluation of the final indices shows that the proposed model has suitable fit. In this way, the research pattern was approved by 5 main components and 30 sub-components.</abstract>
