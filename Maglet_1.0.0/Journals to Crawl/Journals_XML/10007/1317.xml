Quantitative methods and techniques used for evaluating data from the survey (see questionnaire). It studied two areas of Arak city: Hepco (Zone 1) and Ayatollah Saeedi (zone 4) .Research findings suggest that environmental differences are effective on the level of security in the city. People who live in zone1 feel more security than residents of zone 4 at night. Also the women feel more insecurity than men at night. Also between 4 studied subjects (men and women of both areas) men and women of zone 4 use other places for shop and fun more than men and women of zone 1. Also in both areas women use other places more than men .both groups have same ideas about the safe and unsafe places. The majority of them evaluate silent streets, one-way streets and low traffic areas as insecure places. In addition, people considered the presence of police and security forces, promoting the cultural and pay more attention to city design as an important factor of creating the sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;
