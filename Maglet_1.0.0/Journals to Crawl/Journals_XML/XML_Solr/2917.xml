The previous roles have become faint and new opportunities have appeared in petrochemical industry by starting the process of privatization and changing the nature of the company from holding to a governance and development organization. So, the main questions in this study were: what is the similarity among the world popular models about instructional design and workplace learning models? What is the most adaptive model about training and workplace learning in petrochemical industry? Therefore, a qualitative meta-synthesis approach has been used to reply these questions. This process was conducted in two steps. Its first step was conducted by Sandelowski and Barroso method in ۲۰۰۷. The second step was conducted by analysis of documents, observation, and experts' views using Maxqda software. Finally, the related adaptive model to the characteristics of petrochemical industry was offered including five dimentions of: performance analysis, performance design, performance development, performance implementation, and performance monitoring which were adopted from ۷۰:۲۰:۱۰, Mager and human performance technology models. Regarding the dominant systematic approach in instructional design and workplace learning model, and considering of performance conception in all designing processes, it seems that the present study,as the first study in this field, can have an effective role in organizational training. t
