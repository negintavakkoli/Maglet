			<abstract>
			The human resources of any organization are the most valuable factor of production and the main source of competitive advantage, so planning for its development is essential. This study was designed to provide a model for human capital development. The research is applied and descriptive in terms of data collection. This was a descriptive-descriptive survey research using a semi-structured questionnaire and interview. In the first stage, an open questionnaire was prepared to identify the human capital development status in Iran Ministry of Petroleum of Iran. Then, a second questionnaire was designed to extract the relationships between variables, to determine the weighting coefficients of the indices and to present the mathematical model of the research.The statistical population was the experts from Ministry of Petroleum of Iran and based on the specific conditions, a number of its experts were selected as statistical sample. Systems dynamics approach was used to design the model. By using Vensim software, scenario writing was done. Finally, six scenarios were considered and among them &#34;Improvement of training and development software programs&#34; was identified as the strongest scenario and the &#34;Improvement of staffing capability&#34; was selected as the most attractive scenario. According to the results, the Ministry of Petroleum must first empower its staff to develop its human capital. Since empowerment is both objective and subjective, therefore, employees' mental capacity and self-esteem must be enhanced by increasing their skill level and empirical ability to achieve an acceptable level of productivity.

			<abstract>
			Nowadays, psychological traits of managers are among the factors that influence the success of organizations and are a key element of human resource empowerment. The current research aimed to identify psychological traits of Top managers in Oil fields of West Azerbaijan province which has been studied by the combined method (quantitative - qualitative). In the qualitative section, postmodern paradigm, phenomenological strategy, and latent content analysis technique by semi- structured (in-depth) interview (to the theoretical saturation level) with 16 cases of top managers and&#160; purposive sampling method was used for sampling and theoretical saturation was obtained from interviews with 10 individuals. In the quantitative section, using the structural equation modeling by partial least squares method, the reliability and validity of the obtained tool was confirmed. The interviews were analyzed through open coding and axial coding using MAXQDA12 and the Smart Pls2 software has been used to confirm the tool. The psychological Traits of Top Managers in the study community were identified in the four components of altruism, ambition, foresight and compatibility with others and a structural model based on these components was presented and the reliability and fit of the newly created model were evaluated.

			The purpose of this study was to identify and measure the factors affecting talent management in the national gas industry. So, the qualitative and quantitative approaches have been used. Delphi approach in the qualitative part and the Shannon entropy in the quantitative part have been used. For this purpose, a team of 15 experts, including organizational managers as well as academic professors, was selected and the Delphi approach steps have done according to their views. The result of this section, it has been identified 42 variables within the 10 key variables of personal development, organizational strategy, recruitment and selection, performance management, training, compensation, discipline, political factors, labor supply, and laws and regulations that have influenced talent management. Based on the results of the Delphi approach, the effect of the 10 factors on talent management was equal, while some factors may be more effective than others. So, the weighting of the main variables based on the Shannon entropy method according to the opinions of 10 experts was considered. The results showed that performance management has the highest importance and personal development has the lowest importance in talent management.

			This study aimed to investigate the effect of workplace spirituality on comprehensive mental health of employees and its three main dimensions (emotional well-being, psychological well-being, and social well-being). This research is consumed an applied research and the survey method has been used for data collection. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data and test hypotheses. The statistical population of the research included employees of Pazargad petrochemical company located in Asalouyeh. The sample size was determined based on Morgan's table. Finally, 238 employees were selected using simple random sampling. Data gathering tool was Milliman questionnaire for workplace Spirituality and Keyes, continuum-short questionnaire for comprehensive mental health. The validity of both questionnaires has been evaluated in terms of face, content and construct. For reliability testing, Cronbach's alpha coefficient has been used. The value of this coefficient was 0/81 for Millenium questionnaire and 0/84 for Keyes questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS25 and Amos23 software. Findings show that the workplace spirituality variable has a significant coefficient impact of 68% on the comprehensive mental health of employees.

			<abstract>
			Talent management is one of the most important challenges faced by management of companies. Uncertainty in predicting competencies that are critical for companies and the inability to accurately estimate the voluntary of talents turnover, has required adapting concepts from the supply chain management, such as supply and strategic sourcing in talent management. The purpose of this research was to cluster the job occupations of the National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC) in order to provide suitable strategies for sourcing talents in each cluster. This study is considered a quantitative applied research. The research strategy was c-means fuzzy clustering method. The statistical population was all human resources staff in NISOC and the statistical sample consisted of 80 experts from human resources section which have been selected by purposive method. Based on the findings, the job occupations were categorized into four clusters of routine, leverage, bottleneck and critical occupations, and suitable strategies for supplying and sourcing talents for each cluster were proposed.
