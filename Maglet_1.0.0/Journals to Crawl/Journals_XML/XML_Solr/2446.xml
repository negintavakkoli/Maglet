One critical and costly resource is ER personnel and its lack can lead to long queue of patients. Thus appropriate scheduling for nurses and physicians can help ER managers to get maximum benefit of their current human resource and reduce their costs. In this schedule different criteria should be considered. Meeting all of them is difficult for the hospital expert person. Objective of this research is to design an intelligent schedule for ER personnel in order that waiting time is reduced and hospital management constraints are fully considered. First , patient flow in ER is simulated. Secondly, Gentic Algorithm (an Intelligent approach) is applied to solve the multi objective problem. Results show that average and standard deviation of patients waiting time for first visit is reduced by ۷۴٪ and ۵۳٪ respectively.
