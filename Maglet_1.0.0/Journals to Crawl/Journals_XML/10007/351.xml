This study examined documentary and scientific aspects of obstacles and strength points and methods of improving quality of teaching in the Conservatories.

The present research, is descriptive and functional that evaluate the state through the questionnaire that has been developed with regard to objectives of the Conservatory training of Tehran, identify the current status, obstacles and also utilizes information obtained from interviews of teachers and experts in this sector in four fields educational, personal, social, economic and four levels of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;high, medium, low and very low&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Due to gathered information and analysis by SPSS obstacles have been reported high extent that finally guidelines and recommendations in order to quality improvement of current situation is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
