In fact, each project is categorized based on its qualities and appropriate financial instruments are determined according to this criterion. Urban projects have been classified and effective factors on the categorization in urban projects have been identified in this article. Tehran Municipality is compared with some large cities, in this respect. In order to study the issue, equality of external financing of urban projects with transport missions, urban services, and other missions have been examined by using ANOVA analysis, according to the separation of municipal projects to different missions. Better financing can be obtained by better identification and emphasis on the qualities of urban projects of Tehran Municipality and its comparison with other selected cities in the world including Seoul, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur, New York, London, and Istanbul. According to the results, the hypothesis of equivalent amount of external financing municipal projects with municipal service mission in Tehran and other intended cities is not rejected.</field></doc></add>
