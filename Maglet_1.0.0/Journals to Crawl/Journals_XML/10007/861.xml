<Abstract>The process of manufacturing production is not too hard to understand, and is not so easy that everyone know how it begins and where it should be finished. But the obvious matter is the production which is obtained and its name in architecture is objectification to subjective ideas and manufacturing the tangible elements. In fact, the history of transforming idea to production is related to the caveman and it has thousands years antiquity. By appearance of computer, the human can make it help them. Nowadays, especially in recent decades, the computer-aided experience makes their eyes open in new areas. Although some of the computing approaches are not positive and good for them, but we focus on the positive parts of this fact. Now we must answer to some questions: would computer sit on the architectural position? And doesn't design process need to architect as a producer? Also there is some another question that where is the front ring between the traditional and modern architecture? And does computer-aided approach play the same role as a linker factor? Finally, it is necessary to say that the nature of this research is explanatory; also, considering the holistic subject, the main approach is operative.

<Abstract>We spend more than ninety percent of our lives in enclosed spaces. Spaces where people spend most of their time definitely play a significant role in their behavioral and physical well-being. Number of studies in the field of psychology has proven that acquired behaviors are directly influenced by the design of spaces. On the other hand, through the development of buildings quality, along with the advancements in technology, industry, and attention to the global environmental conditions, many buildings have addressed environmental approaches. By related advertisement, media communication and the consideration of the potentials of buildings with a sustainable and green approach, these buildings have often fallen positive into the minds of the audience, but, as a group of researchers believes, mismatches of residents' satisfaction within the environment of these spaces is established. The quality level that inhabitant experiences is shaped by factors such as welcoming entrances, children's play spaces, lobby, indoor and outdoor gathering spaces and community hall, which in general shape social well-being and comfort among inhabitants towards social interactions. &amp;nbsp;This study aims to cover the research objectives by assessing the quality of the inhabitants experience compared to the common spaces of residential buildings with an environmental approach in Tehran. The research has been conducted in four residential buildings with environmental approach in Tehran. In this regard, 204 questionnaires are distributed in these four residential buildings. The analysis process has been implemented by the K-S and AVALUE programs in the SPSS2 tool. The researcher is trying to focus on the role of public spaces and common areas in Tehran's residential buildings and the impact of social interactions of residents on the quality level of residents' experience in terms of the component of social sustainability. This quantitative research can draw the attention of researchers and architects to the importance of public spaces in current and future residential buildings.

<Abstract>The present paper aims to consider the latest research achievements surrounding urban views and their role, seeking to understand a comprehensive model of human and perceptual dimensions, in order to fit the structure of the urban wall. Considering the reciprocal relationship between the environment and the human, the question of what components can affect the formation of identity in an individual and society. According to the teachings and human life categories, his needs are grouped in two physical and spiritual arenas, and the urban features can be achieved when people and society are formed into identity dimensions and the different needs of the individual. Architectural spaces provides the physical and psychological needs of man in a relative manner, but can only provide a platform to provide his spiritual and spiritual needs, as the evolution of human evolution is a conscious one. Space builders can help with knowledge of the effective elements on the individual's perception of the environment with a rich environmental design and emphasis on perceptual elements as part of the environment. the environment in which physical, perceptual, semantic, and functional systems function properly can be used by appropriate individual and collective valuating to train individual perceptions in the environment and stimulate cultural wealth. This happens when the dominant eye on environmental design fits into society's values and identity, and by respecting individual and collective identity, it can achieve this person and the environment.

<Abstract>From the peripheral vision, the central court has performed well as an efficient and efficient means to protect residents from adverse weather and environmental conditions and to benefit from non - active energies in the regions (hot and dry) and (warm and humid). The discovery of the hidden angles of the environmental and climatic function of the central courtyard in the traditional urban settlements of the country is an unknown issue that this study seeks to answer. For this purpose, traditional house houses of Tabriz have been selected as a study sample. This study aims to study the physical structure, patterns and variations of the central courtyard in traditional housing units of Tabriz based on effective elements on thermal treatment of حیاط&amp;zwnj;ها to their typology. In order to perform the research of 120 examples of traditional houses of Tabriz in the historical range of the city, the identification and number of 64 houses that had full information and documents were selected for typology. The results of typology the factor towards other factors in determining the governing angles on the direction of the houses. It is in the sense that courtyards are closer to a square shape. Courtyards of area (100 - 300 m) have the highest frequency among the studied samples. The depletion of the area and the increase of the compound confinement face difficulty in the cold season due to deep shadows on adjacent surfaces of the courtyard, non - active heating of the adjacent spaces adjacent to the compound. The maximum frequency ratio is to a group of yards, the length of which is 2.5 times the height of them and the courts with a width of 2 equal to the height of the bodies are the highest. The rise of the sidewalls, especially in the south, will lead to vast shadows in the adjacent surfaces of the courtyard and thus reduce the quality of thermal comfort in the cold seasons of these regions.

Observations in general were made in 3 places, residential areas, green spaces, city centers, from 7 am to 1 in the night. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the social and demographic characteristics that observers have identified. Rather, the interpretation of observers is one of the ways determined by the groups assigned to it. As a result, the language and label that are used for each group will be used in this document. The study also analyses whether the interactions are different from the age or with the location. Or does the presence of people or special groups influence the use of public space.

<Abstract>During the last four decades, the maximum buildings, especially tall buildings in cities have designed urban architectural buildings using structural metal systems. While metal structures include many weaknesses in relation to the climate and components of bioclimatic design, weakness and difficulty of implementation and structural components in developmental dimensions and fluidity and flotation and components of avoiding form rigidity and volumetric dynamic from architectural aspect. On the other hand, shell structures could promote the mentioned disadvantages to a large extent and provide more balanced design. In this paper, types of shell structures and their structural characteristics and analysis are mentioned and the examples used are mentioned in the architecture of tall buildings and other architectural spaces.

<Abstract>More than half of world's population lives in urban areas. Permanent increasing population has also affected peri-urban areas during this 100 years. Peri-urban areas are formed in an organic and without planning sense by new comers who belong to the lower middle class and low-income urban residents. Naysar was formerly a small settlement placed in the east of Sanandaj, but during two very recent decades it has experienced a tremendous increasing amount of settlers then merged into Sanandaj City immediately. The purpose of this study is to investigate the metamorphosis of peri-urban areas emphasizing on Naysar according to the view three different groups of community including: specialists, academics, and settlers of Naysar. The analysis has been done by considering social, economic, environmental, and institutional management approaches. The findings of the research show several factors influencing on spatial metamorphosis: urban poverty, neighboring and accessibility, The lack of supervision of urban management on land transactions and the change in the use of land located in the city on the increase in the population identified the effective study area. Economic problems lead the lower middle class community to settle in Naysar and land use of Naysar has been changed in parallel with changing characteristics of population.

<Abstract>Renovation of worn-out tissues has been activated in recent years, as if the municipality, without the participation of people, intends to renovate worn out tissues, also through the possession of people's places of business. And the only legal right of the people was to give their homes their homes at the expense of the day and forced displacement of their area, which they had for many years admired and searched for. Zone 12 is deteriorating due to the deterioration of tissues. If, in the next few years, the municipality does not use the residents' participation and based on the detailed plan of the region to organize the worn out textiles, many monuments and monuments as well as residential buildings will be destroyed. The purpose of this research is to investigate the participatory approach in organizing the worn out tissues of the 12th district of Tehran. The research is descriptive-analytical and data collection is done using library and field method. The statistical population of this research includes experts. The multi-stage random sampling method has been used and the information has been analyzed using Tapsis method. And the results show that the benign and old criteria of construction and the risk of earthquake damage (0.735193) have been able to rank first. In order to operationalize the participatory approach in organizing the worn out texture, the sustainable partnership process can be used as a comprehensive approach.

<Abstract>The speed and size of urban population growth and the increase in the number of cities in the in developing countries have been the result of many problems and problems. These problems are mainly due to the need to meet the widespread and increasing needs of urban management with the ability of urban management to respond and resolve them. Meanwhile, the role of urban management as the helm of the city is more than ever. The critical point is that the gaps due to the scrutiny of the role and status of urban management in the heart of the nation's sovereign complex as well as the lack of integration of urban management on numerous. Tehran metropolis as a leading role in urban urbanization, in the critical conflict of social, economic and political changes surrounding the values of democracy in modern and modern times, requires changes and transformations to a sovereign set. Hence, these changes are around the determinants of optimal position of management of Tehran metropolis in the country's administrative structure. in this thesis, using documentary and field research, the present study tries to provide a suitable model for such a role and position. the results of this study show that in drawing the optimal model of urban management of Tehran metropolis and its proper place in the political and administrative structure of the world, it is necessary to map a system look, top and bottom processes and urban management relations with citizens, central government, and local government and market as the main actor in urban management. If the local government icon is not realized because of the limitations of the political structure and the constitution, it is at least allowed to wear the local management mantle to be directed toward the integrated and unified management of the city.

<Abstract>Following the industrial, labor and socialist revolutions and, consequently, the entry into the modern era in recent centuries, there have been two streams leading to the industrialization and mass production. The first stream was associated with growing socialist viewpoints safeguarding the interests of workers, which sought to provide better living conditions for the working class through the construction of residential settlements with an industrial approach. The second stream was the consequence of contemporary capitalism, which was supposed to support international thoughts in order to protect and develop its own interests by achieving the global construction market. The Islam as a comprehensive religion presents principles and instructions which have a social status. It seems that industrialized construction as part of the industrialization process aims to establish ideals that can be shared with social goals of the Islam. In construction industry, the fundamental question of the research is that which industrialized building systems coincide with the Islamic goals. In this study, the research hypothesis suggests that there are criteria in the teachings related to Islamic housing, which can evaluate industrialized building systems. This study aims to classify industrialized building systems in accordance with Islamic criteria of housing. The study seeks to evaluate industrialized building systems by categorizing Islamic criteria of housing. Subsequently, the results of evaluation are examined in comparison with actual cases and the correlation between the results is confirmed. In this study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is employed for the accuracy of results. This study is an applied research. The information is collected through library research and Internet websites. Semi-structured interviews with experts are also used to satisfy the selected Islamic and industrial criteria. According to the results of this research, there are criteria in Islamic architecture and housing that can be realized more by some industrialized building systems. Hence fully prefabricated building system and fully automated prefabricated building system gain the highest score in meeting the selected Islamic criteria. The results of this study will be utilized to enrich the industrialized architecture and Islamic housing literature and can serve as a source of thoughts to help the process of decision making by managers and builders.

<Abstract>The purpose of this study was to design a risk breakdown structure and prioritize its levels in Isfahan municipality. In this regard, the presentation of the objectives of the construction projects in project risk management has been considered. This research was conducted to determine the risk breakdown structure through comparative studies, semi-structured interviews, and a questionnaire. Finally, prioritizing the levels of risk breakdown structure, the objectives of the projects were accomplished through improved hierarchical fuzzy topology technique. Due to the fact that in classical Tapis, the mean value and standard deviation are not a complete measure for comparison of two fuzzy numbers, in order to eliminate this defect, the coefficient of variation has been used. This descriptive survey is of a survey type of a practical nature and periodic time. The data gathering tool included review of documentation, Delphi technique and researcher-made questionnaires by drawing an abstract ladder, its content and content validity was evaluated by Lavasheh method and its reliability was confirmed by the internal consistency determination method and in general 29 risk categories in The third level was identified and ranked in three levels and ranked in the second and third levels.
