The 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 managers selected purposefully (maximum variation sampling) from among the different levels of management in Isfahan Gas Company. Also, Gas monthly magazine, web sites of&#160; National Iranian Gas Company and&#160; thirty province and&#160; job description of managers selected purposefully (theoretical sampling) and studied. Then based on grounded theory, in the open coding phase, concepts were collected and categorized into 8 main categories and 78 sub categories. In the phase of axial coding, the link between these categories were determined in the form of coding paradigm under titles of causal conditions, core phenomenon, mutual action/reaction strategies, context, intervening conditions, obstacles, and the consequences of managerial competencies. In the selective coding phase, the story line was sketched out and the propositions were generated. Finally، theory fitting accepted.</abstract>
