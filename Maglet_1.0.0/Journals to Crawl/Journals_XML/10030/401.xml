	<Abstract>This article presents a new aspect of the poems of Soltan Valad, Jalaleddin Mohammad Moulawi's senior son.&#160; In his poetry, one may spot a new prosodic feature which is drastically different from all classical Persian poems. This difference is so significant that one can hardly attribute it to such typical errors made by scribes, typists or publishers. After highlighting this feature, the author presents two possible factors underlying this difference: The contrasts in the phonological system of the Persian words due to proximity with the Greek and Turkish languages in Qunieh, and the impact of the music dominating the House of Dervishes and the style of the story tellers and writers of that age.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Unlike ancient rhetoricians who rejected ambiguity altogether, modern theorists consider it as a value. This article, initially, presents a historical survey as well as the modern approaches to ambiguity and highlights the modern aesthetic tendency toward ambiguity and polysemy. After the early years of 20th century, ambiguity was considered as the essential essence of literary texts by literary critics and theorists. Second, the article discusses the value of ambiguity in literary works and draws a borderline between difficulty and polysemy (i.e. pluralization and multiple meaning). Then, it introduces some kinds of ambiguity and elaborates on their distinct features. Meanwhile, this article pinpoints the basic deference between language and literature through emphasizing the value and function of ambiguity.&#160; The main purpose of the article, then, is to emphasis that &#34;ambiguity as inherent nature of literature&#34; and stresses the principle saying: &#34;the artistic value of a literary work and the secret of its eternality depend on the amount of its ambiguity&#34;. If one ignores the ambiguity in literary texts, he would lose its spirit and essential essence. Ambiguity causes an interaction between&#160;&#160; reader and text and fosters the ability of meaning creation by readers.&#160; Through persuading the readers to react to the content of text, ambiguity provides the opportunities for generations to engage in different dialogues with text across time and history.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>This article examines a letter from Beyhagi s history,&#160;based on pragmatic theories. Based on this approach, the context of situation, diexis, including: social, personal, time and spatial diexis are analyzed in the text. In other words, the communicative competence of the writer or his linguistic knowledge and his application of rules in different situations are taken into consideration. Since the communicative competence of the writer is interrelated with his attitude and motivation and in so far as the description of language functions in a text can illustrate some of the linguistic features, not explicitly cited in the text, such analyses may play an important role in our literature. To this end, the segmental elements like words, and sentences as well as&#160; some supra segmental features like stress and intonation are analyzed in the text.&#160;</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Nezami Ganjavi enjoys a worldwide reputation as a great poet. His story-telling is based on reality. Together with his indescribable imagination, this feature has made him a distinguished poet in the realm of humanism and psychiatry. It seems that his genius is best depicted in Haft Peykar (Seven Planets) especially in his seven tales containing the inner layer as well as the outside elements of the story. One can go from the surface structure of his poems to the deep structure of his human character and, hence, discover the hidden aspects of his human character. A remarkable story in Haft-Peykar is the story of &#34;Khair&#34; and &#34;shar&#34;. The theme of this story is a debate between two young people called Kheir (good) and Shar (evil/bad). This story can be interpreted in terms of psychology of the young. According to this classic psychological theory, the hidden aspects have a special status in manُ s spirit.These aspects sometimes manifest themselvessymbolically in humanُ's consciousness. In this story, good symbolizes humanُ s consciousness and bad/evil is the symbol of shadow and humanُ s subconscious. These two aspects finally reach a unity after a long debate with each other. The numerous archetypes such as anima, shadow, rebirth, journey, water and tree play significant roles in this struggle. The present paper is an attempt to shed some lights on these aspects.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Simile is one of the main forms of imagination in any literature serving other forms of imagination because the principle in such images is of &#8220;the sameness&#8221; kind. Likewise, this figure is used in different forms of imagination such as metaphor, variety, expansion and freshness in the poems by Sepehri. This paper examines various views on the quantity and quality of his images, having or not having frames and classifies the allegories employed by him through reviewing a corpus of his well-known samples. The paper is based on different types of simile in terms of bases, sensibility and wisdom of the parties, variety of the parties, etc. in order to categorize the samples. Nevertheless, in his review of the samples, the author has not limited himself to the traditional views but has also studied the new European schools of thought. One way to recognize the ideas of poets and uncover the corners of their minds is to explore the images in their poems. Accordingly, the present research has tried to examine the underlying thoughts of the poet as well as his attitudes.</Abstract>
