	<Abstract>Sufi and mystic poets employ linguistic evidence, especially expressions regarding animals, to represent mystic concepts. In this study, to explore and clarify the meanings Mulana intended to convey as the field of destination, we will examine the linguistic expression &#8220;the Lion&#8221; as the field of origination in ghazals of Divan Kabir by using the conceptual theories of metaphor introduced by George Lakoff and Mark Johnsen. Studies have shown that Mulana, by utilizing linguistic economy and provoking multiple mental images with the use of a single expression (lion), has successfully exhibited a vital and variegated spectrum of his mystic thoughts.&#160; According to the frequency explored in this article, the expression &#8216;lion&#8217; in the mystic conceptual system of Mulana enjoys a positive meaning; heart and love are more significant in comparison to reason; the crucial concept of &#8220;complete man&#8221; against human ego and &#8220;beloved&#8221; are used to represent the absolute superiority of God through visual representation of &#8220;the lion&#8221;. All in all, employing the expression of the lion to point to sublime meanings and concepts central to mysticism is an indication of Mulana&#8217;s idealistic spirit, his sanguinity and sublimated nature. In this piece of research, which is carried out through a descriptive-analytical method, after an introductory note on conceptual metaphor, origination of animal metaphors, and Mulana&#8217;s metaphoric language, the writers provide different verses as an example of different kinds of destination fields. Determining the conceptual framework, field of origination or emotive field, application of various meanings&#8217; general and local inscription in each category would be the next step. Finally, the frequency of the fields of destination and their conceptual generalizations will be presented in a table and the data will be explicated. &#160;&#160;

	<Abstract>Through a rhetorical system, poets&#8217; and writers&#8217; worldview is reflected in their literary works. One effective factor in forming or changing these viewpoints is the happenings and changes of the world poets dwell on different levels. Simile is an important structure in the rhetorical system. In this piece of research the writers have tried to show how structure of simile in Bidel reveals transformations in the texture of situation on different levels through establishing relations with other rhetorical structures. Moreover, the research also investigates how vivid or subdued transformations in the current period affect the horizon of expectation of previous ages resulting in the formation of new horizons. In this article, the poems of Bidel are regarded as a field the intrinsic transformations in which can be attributed to other fields such as Hindi style of poetry. Through this study, it became obvious that not only the poet (Bidel) sometimes creates new structures out of old similes, but also he establishes new structures by creating chains of similes networks, resulting in the abundance of syntactic images, or&#160; several images using multidimensional words, etc. In the following article, situational texture of Safavid era, linguistic texture of Hindi style, its common simile structures, and at last, new simile structures and their features in Bidel&#8217;s poems are studied.

	<Abstract>Implied author and implied reader are components of a narrative structure, playing a crucial role in illuminating hidden elements within a text. Therefore, studying these elements in literary works can expose the underlying layers of narration and open up new critical outlooks to the readers. Furthermore and in cases of cinematic adaptations, it explains whether this was the novel or the film that has managed to unravel narrative complexities of the other medium more successfully and better facilitate audience understanding. The novel GavKhuni and its film adaptation are among works in which the plot is not causal, but internal and fluid. Thus, the reader has to decode textual evidence in order to understand how conceptions and viewpoints are formed in characters. Afkhami&#8217;s adaptation of GavKhuni is totally loyal and all elements of the story are faithfully mirrored in the film. However, Afkhami has made use of these elements to present his own ideological concepts. Repetition is a method that both the author and the director have used to transfer their ideas to the audience. Using a descriptive-analytical methodology and a narratological and inter-disciplinary approach, the present research attempts to analyze the ways in which implied author and reader are represented in the novel and the film. Since the author and the reader of each era are thrown into their work and new meanings are discovered in fulfillment of their expectations, thus the audience of this novel and film would discover new meanings from out of the narrative text of GavKhuni as well as its adaptation.

	<Abstract>This research explains the principles governing major codes of &#34;Hodhod&#34; and &#34;Simorgh&#34; in the Attar's Mantiq al-Tayr, and codes of &#34;The King of Birds&#34; and the &#34;Storyteller Bird&#34; in the Avicenna's Risalat Al-Tayr. The significance of this study lies in its endeavor to abolish ambiguities regarding the meanings of these cods which due to personal and subjective trends of interpretation and commentary on these allegorical works is institutionalized. This study tackles the issue of necessary allegorical and coded writing styles when texts came to deal with epistemological concepts which was a result of conceptual conflicts that existed from fifth century to seventh century, and forced interpretations on texts&#8217; meanings which were merely a reflection and satisfaction of expectations of critics of an age. This study is library research and is based on a thorough examination of the content of relevant literature on this subject, each in its pertinent context, followed by a co-examination of intersections between the texts and the contexts. This study concludes its premises through deep analysis and critically supported interpretations. The findings of this study reveal the contradictions that govern interpretations of the aforementioned concepts. Furthermore, findings of this study demonstrate the necessity of further investigation in this field

	<Abstract>Firdowsi's Shahnameh, the poetic mythological epic of Iran, is created on the base of opposite forces of the world, namely Iran and Aniran and the battles of their people, because the design of the mythological history of Iran is also basically created on the intercourse of opposites .One of the most comprehensive philosophical views on history is&#160; Friedrich Hegel's attitude. In this view, the nature and purpose of history is the same as nature of the human, and the nature of the human is the attainment of consciousness and freedom. This freedom can only be realized gradually and dialectically; hence, in the Hegelian philosophy the war is a way to dialectical furtherance of history and the inception of the struggle between human beings, as gods and servants, has been introduced as the basis for achieving self-consciousness. The battle between human beings in Firdowsi's Shahnameh resembles the dialectical relation of &#34;Gods and Servants&#34; in Hegel's philosophy. In the mythological part of Shahnameh, the achievement of self-consciousness is only through the battle of the two sides of the opposition, as gods and servants in the battles between Jamshid and Zahak, Zahak and Kaveh (and then Fereydoun), the sons of Fereydoun, and the subsequent martyrdom of Iraj and his reprisal by Manuchehr. This essay, with an analytical-descriptive approach, will analyze the philosophy of the history of Firdowsi's Shahnameh, emphasizing&#160; the relation between &#34;gods and servants&#34;, and concludes that in this work all conflicts will achieve a resolution that can be identified as the moments of Hegelian dialectic, and in fact, the path to self-awareness and freedom, and this is the same as the possibility of reading&#160; philosophy of mythical history of Iran in Firdowsi's Shahnameh based on Hegelian philosophy of history.

	<Abstract>Shahnameh of Ferdowsi has been continuously studied by numerous researchers and scholars from literary, mythological and cultural aspects. One of the rarely and less noticed issues in this regard is investigating the ideological role and function of language in this piece of literature based on a certain adopted theory and method. In other words, the writers of this article try to understand how Ferdowsi utilizes language to engender the ideology of Iranian superiority and revive Iranian identity by producing the relevant discourse. To achieve this goal, the current study has been constructed over the theoretical framework of critical discourse analysis introduced by the famous linguist Teun&#160;van&#160;Dijk. We also focus on the battle of Rostam and Chengesh in the story of &#8220;Rostam and Chinese Khaghan&#8221; (&#8220;Rostam and the king of China&#8221;) to restrict the research area. The results show that Ferdowsi employs some strategies such as ideological polarization,&#160;positive self-presentation,&#160;negative other-presentation,&#160;lexicalization,&#160;and actor description&#160;to make a discourse on the supremacy of the Iranians.

	<Abstract>One of the important functions of every Semiotic system is its local function. In a discourse, places have various roles such as objective, acting, being, abstract, narrative and mythical. In addition they have referential, narrative, tensional, metaphorical and transcendental functions and they play a role in creation of meaning. By strengthening objective and physical aspects of place, its cognitive dimension gets strong, while by making these aspects weaker its metaphorical dimensions are strengthened. Therefore, place is transformed into space disruption. In the &#34;The Night when Sohrab was killed&#34;, place transforms in a way in relation to acting discourse, reciprocity and their interaction; Place becomes flexible and acquires a trans-place characteristic. The main question of the research is how and by what process does transformation of place happen, and what function leads to this transformation.&#160; The current research is on the basis of the hypothesis that place in accordance with its functions of reciprocity, interaction, and interactive action-oriented features acquires an identity and static function. The effect of such functions on place is that it leads to its flexibility in the realm of place and space and eventually it becomes an existential and transformational place, which its main output, on the one hand, is interaction of the actor and place and on the other hand, its unity and harmony with Sohrab's mythical features and universe. The purpose of this research is to study Semiotic characteristics of place and space and to analyze conditions, place transformation and conversion of place into trans-place. This research showed that different continuous locations, non-continuations, induction, whirlwinds, and transcendence play a role in this discourse, and so these places always have active, static, emotional, inductive, mythical and transcendental functions.

	<Abstract>Moralistic and didactic texts make up a large part of Persian literature. Undoubtedly, if &#34;the inculcation of a particular concept into the mind of the reader and the attempt to persuade and conquer his mind&#34; is not the main purpose of these texts, it is definitely one of their most important goals. In this sense, the poet or writer of such texts tries to persuade the reader and sway his mind to his desired position. This paper has extracted various methods of &#8220;capturing the mind of the reader&#8221; in Golestan by Saadi, and has divided these methods into four general categories and nine sub-categories. The most frequent statistical frequency in the methods of persuading the audience in Golestan is the argument, with a frequency of 30%, and then the allegory with a frequency of 26,6%, which shows argumentative and literary aspects of the Iranian mind to be active.

	<Abstract>The two ancient civilizations of Iran and India, due to their long-standing cultural, political and economic relations, have had a relative cognition of each other's identity, which has, over time, become more logical, complete, and at times symbolic. Undoubtedly, in order to understand the history of Iran and India in ancient times and how these two nations interacted, we must inevitably find the historical image of India in Iranian culture. The study of myth, epic literature and versifications helps us to reach historical realities. Shahnameh can represent Iranian and Indian history and culture. In this research, we seek to answer the main question by using descriptive-analytical method and library resources. To a large extent, Firdowsi has remained faithful to historical sources and Pahlavi texts in Shahnameh. The text shows that Firdowsi has followed the sources that have been used and there is no significant difference between them especially those of the Sassanid era, such as Karnameh Ardeshir Babakan, A Relic from Zariran and Kodaynamak and Shahnameh.&#160;

	<Abstract>Since human soul seeks excellence, he continuously hunts for answers to his questions. Therefore, he works towards tools to help him achieve a better life, create a dream world (Armanshahr) or utopia; a nowhere; his desired world. The Sufis has been more attentive to the local realities of their society, and they saw the society full of shortcomings and sought to lead their people into a desirable world by knowing the existing society and understanding its shortcomings and failures. The mystic understanding of Sanaei, Attar and Rumi of utopia is different from the perception of philosophers and scholars. In this way, scholars, poets and writers attribute some features to utopia, and although these features share some commonalities, they are different in some aspects as well. In this research, we have tried to study the main literary works of the 6th and 7th centuries through descriptive-analytical methods to, on the one hand, explore the evolution of the concept of utopia in the works of the elders of Persian mystic poetry, and on the other hand to explore the characteristics of their utopias and their differences according to the socio-political characteristics of that period.</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Narrative process and its narrative mechanisms help the reader make sense of the way events happen in a story. Using repeating images in the text of a story is a method of narrative development.&#160; In Shahnameh, dealing with the world and images it gives rise to is one of the central motives of the text. The narrator in different parts of the poem seems captivated by the image of the world and this fact impedes narrative progress. This article intends to analyze &#8220;the images of the world&#8221; in &#8220;the story of Siavash&#8221; in Shahname from Gerard Genette&#8217;s perspective, employing his five narrative features. This narrative by the use of prior narration, repeating narration and focalization presents an image of the world, this technique also pinpoints the way a specific image of a special theme has the potential to reduce the speed of reader comprehension by tampering with the order of events narrated or actions or by disrupting narrative time, and as a result it can boost the texts suspense or the reader&#8217;s interest in knowing how the events will evolve.

	<Abstract>With the development of Bakhtin's theory of polyphony in literary criticism, the kind of attitude to literary texts has changed, and according to the needs of modern society, this discourse became the focus of attention of thinkers and literary theorists. Polyphony, with its own meta-lingual potentials, brings with it a new approach, a rethinking of the audience, so that the reader can have a new range of experiences. In this research, employing Bakhtinian dialogical logic, it is possible to examine Sange Saboor as polyphonic and dialogical. Sange Saboor has a special structure that differs from other works of Chubak and utilizes components such as the plurality of voices, the use of stream of consciousness, internal&#160; monologue, intertextuality,&#160; two-way discourse, literary schools, etc. The author of this article attempts to find the features that turn the text polyphonic and explore their function.&#160;
