	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;It seems that success in municipal wastes management has a detectable relationship with citizens' participation and social mechanisms. So, the present study has done for recognition of systematic relations of effective social parameters on municipal solid waste administration. Data have collected in two phase to fill of questionnaires including awareness assessment of MSW office's personnel of urban 22-district Tehran municipality organization and effective factors on MSW management; Then, social parameters relations effective on MSW via S-LCA in different phases such as temporary storage, gathering, transportation and processing, recycling and proper disposal. Results shown that was got 16 grading (than 20) of municipal waste administration awareness by personnel of MSW office in district that has counted including good grades. Waste management of district municipality has got final grading equal 72 (than 100) that shown have good performance (71-90), but the worst was source separation of waste with grading 24 (than 40) rather than other stages. The most important social factor effective on waste's LCA has were social acceptability that got more final weight (0.49) and among these indices such as noise pollution and private space have more importance. Then, social performance and equality play a same role that social performance in addition to the recycling of start point, destination and job creation, be influenced by social acceptability; Social equality is influenced by distribution and locating index, as well as, quality employment. Average of normal values for indices of each component in different scenarios has shown transfer station scenario has the highest ratio of social acceptability (1.8) and performance (0.7) and caused low amount of social impacts. In other side, landfill scenario (direct way) has the lowest normal value of social equality (0.8). Albeit, due to the weight of social acceptability of first scenario (temporary storage of waste in transfer station and transfer of them to final landfill waste), is desirable, environmentally has advantages than two other scenarios, such as direct job creation, lower fuel consumption and visual pollution prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
