				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This study was run in a bid to determine the optimized portfolio projects of construction based on mixed approach including analytical hierarchy process and additive ratio assessment through using various assessment indicators. This approach consists of two stages which are taken as a means of deliberate decision making in planning and investigating expenditure of limited available resources. For this purpose, in the early stage of investigation, assessment indicators of construction projects were emerged as a result of library study. Thereupon, in the initial stage of suggestive approach, the assessment indicators were identified and then weighed up through running analytical hierarchy process as well as interviewing with elites and experts. In the later stage, the construction projects were ranked through running additive ratio assessment as well as using weighed assessment indicators and also through investigating the interview administered to statistical population. The findings revealed that compatibility of construction projects indicators with strategic purpose, cost and expenditure of construction projects stood at the first and second rank of indicators with coefficient of (32%) and (26%) respectively. Moreover, the indicators of recent innovations in construction projects stood at the third rank of indicators with coefficient of (0.06). Finally, a list of ranked construction projects is made through optimized portfolio project as a result of investigation.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Combat power is an indication of military capability to accomplish the assigned missions in military organizations and making an attempt to enhance combat power is of crucial significance for commanders in military units. In a bid to enhance the combat power in military organizations, many factors were identified in which commanding and leadership style is among crucial and determining factors. Moreover, the military organizations are taken as crucial and influential organization in the community which makes serious attempts to preserve the national security. As an applied study and also descriptive research, this study was an attempt to investigate the effect of transformational leadership styles on enhancing the combat power in defensive organizations. The study was conducted through library and field research; the study was also conducted through engaging randomly selected population of 210 personnel affiliated to one of the defensive organizations. The study was run through administering a questionnaire in which the reliability was estimated and releasing (91%) and its validity was estimated and releasing (88%). The findings revealed that all components of transformational leadership style are effectively enhancing the combat power in defensive organizations. These components including intellectual stimulation with coefficient of (0.347), idealized influence (0.434), inspirational motivation (0.417) and individual consideration with coefficient of (0.463). ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The Middle East is identified as a region which is crucial in terms of geopolitical and geostrategic changes. Consequently, this area turned to be a center of attention in recent years. It is also estimated that the population of U.S military forces will increase more than 35000 in the Middle East in the year of 2014. Additionally, the precise distributions of American military forces are not identified in the Middle East due to the military and political sensitivity. From among U.S military bases throughout the world 50 military bases in the west of Asia and also around Iran is affiliated to the U.S military forces. Therefore, identification of U.S military bases is of crucial significance in the Middle East due to the U.S growing threats. Moreover, utilization of spatial statistical analysis could lead to the identification of U.S military forces. This study was an investigation of the spatial distribution of U.S military bases in the Middle East through utilizing hot spot analysis of ARC in GIS. The findings revealed that in terms of deployment of U.S military forces, most of U.S military threats to Iran from the east area are posed from the countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan and from the south area these threats are posed from the countries including Arab emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman. Moreover, the direct threats of U.S military forces is not remarkable in the other geographical area and most of the U.S military threats is related to the proxy threat from America. Therefore, the development and implementation of defensive strategies in military sphere is highly suggested by the researcher. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In an attempt to explore the appropriate commanding model from the perspective of Imam Khamenei (the Supreme Commander-In-Chief; May His Shadow Extend), this applied study was conducted based on data-based analysis and grounded theory. For this purpose and also in order to identify and explain the components of the appropriate commanding model in thought of the supreme leader –in-chief,  in terms of statistical population, the study was conducted through investigating the Imam Khamenei’s (May His Shadow Extend)discourse and statements during the years of 1989 until 2015. To address this issue, the features of components were classified through administering face to face interview with experts and commanders. Thereupon, the conceptual model and paradigmatic pattern were emerged and developed as a result of data analysis. This model has worked on the most effective components of an appropriate commanding model which were observed and also respected in many armies throughout the world, these components including accountability, maintaining discipline as well as observing the rules and regulators. Moreover, some specific components are identified as unique components to the Islamic republic of Iran including lofty ideal and idealism, moral virtues, paying attention to consolidation of internal power and its preservation as well as maintaining self-oriented power, justice and equality, avoidance of luxurious life and enemy identification. ]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Building the different layers of electronic defense through using the security, technical and defensive capacities requires long-term strategic planning in order to confront the electronic threats. For this purpose, this study was conducted to achieve the electronic defense strategies of the Iranian army against electronic threats as well as identifying the internal and external effective factors affecting the electronic defense. To conduct this study, data collection procedures were run through a field and library research in which quantitative data was run through mean analysis and qualitative data was run through content analysis and then all the data were run and analyzed through mixed method. In terms of statistical population, the study was conducted through engaging 100 personnel affiliated to the operational, IT centers and also the electronic warfare units of the Iranian army. Moreover, due to the consistency of sample and statistical population, no hypothesis is stated by the researcher. Finally, the electronic defense situation of Iranian army was determined in a competitive environment through assessment of space matrix situation. Thereupon, the environmental analysis was run through SWOT model in which 10 strategies were emerged and prioritized in terms of invasion and competition]]></dcterms:abstract>
