				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This paper tries to provide a socio-technical explanation of the formation and transition of Iran's defense Industries in the past 50 years. The main framework using a combination of technical and social elements to make such explanation is the multi-level perspective (MLP). This framework describes transition through interaction of different landscape, regime and niches levels in socio- technical systems, such as defense industry, but in the developing world transition is the path of formation of these levels. In this paper, Bourdieu's field theory is applied to understand regime and niche formation. According to Bourdieu's field theory, we narrate how niche and regime positions are produced as two cores of socio-technical field in Iran defense industries. Focusing on anti-armor industries, we elaborate the three periods of transition in Iran's defense industries to "Dual Core Field" by means of Bourdieu's triple levels of inquiry. In each of these periods — named as "the waves" —defense field and its habitus has certain conditions. In the first wave, the exploitation of "Turn-Key" plants in a hierarchal structure occurs. In the second, the hierarchical is broken, bottom-up forces become active and technological learning accelerates. Industrial regimes grow in greenhouses. In the third wave, the niche cores are formed in the industry.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Technology diffusion is one of the most important goals, and of course a challenge, of innovation systems, especially in developing countries. Renewable energy technology sector is among those seriously facing the problem of technology diffusion, and in recent years Iran has supported the use of renewable energies. In this paper, we study the diffusion of renewable energy technologies. To do so, by reviewing the published literature, we try to identify and analyze valid and reliable studies using grounded theory method. The results reveal a model including 4 factors: technology push, demand pull, investment attractiveness, and regulatory conditions.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The literature of innovation, innovation management, open innovation at firm level, tremendous changes in firm's environment and firm's tough competitive situation points to the need for taking an open approach to maximizing firms' value-added by combining firms internal and external capabilities. In this study, we propose some essential principles for opening Iran's defense firms' innovation process. By reviewing the literature, 21 principles for improving firms' innovation are extracted, and then increased to 25 principles by conducting exploratory interviews with related experts. After that, an initial questionnaire is designed, and its internal consistency is confirmed by the contribution of 50 experts and by computing the Cronbach's alpha. Its validity is also confirmed by the experts' views. The extracted principles are clustered by principal component analysis (PCA), factor loading with eigenvalue>1, and varimax matrix with absolute value of factor loading >0.6. The final questionnaire is designed by Likert-scale and answered by 245 defense innovation experts, and analyzed by LISREL software. The results show that defense firms must design and implement an open integrated process firstly, then implement the associated infrastructure systems with open approach for supporting this innovation process. Creating suitable organizational context is in the third priority because of its time-consuming nature.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Considering the role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in achieving economic and social goals and the introduction of knowledge-based economy, the performance of knowledge-based SMEs calls for more attention than ever. In these companies, innovation is essential for survival. Therefore, in this study the effect of three components of market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation and learning orientation on organizational innovation, and then organizational innovation impact on the performance of the companies based in Khorasan Science and Technology Park, in Khorasan province, Iran, is investigated. For this purpose, 90 out of 143 companies located in the park are selected. A questionnaire is used for data collection, and its validity and reliability is tested and approved by surveying management teachers and by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The result of the analysis performed by SPSS and SMARTPLS software shows that entrepreneurial orientation positively influences the firms' performance and innovation, and therefore the firms' innovation has a complete mediatory role in the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and the firms' performance. On the other hand, no direct relationship is found between market orientation and the firms' performance; however, the relationship between market orientation and the firms' innovation and between the firms' innovation and firms' performance are confirmed, meaning that the firms' innovation has a partial mediatory role in this relationship. The results confirm a relationship between learning orientation and performance, but it is revealed that in these firms learning orientation does not impact innovation. Thus the mediatory effect of innovation on the relationship between learning orientation and the firms' performance is found to be partial.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Today social innovation is a critical and vital issue in communities. However, reviewing the literature reveals a wide variety of interpretations and definitions of social innovation, and little integration among various authors. Therefore, analyzing existing definitions and presenting an obvious, clear, comprehensive and integrated definition for social innovation necessary, which could help authors come to common understanding and reasoning. To this end, by referring to valid and available documents, 100 valid definitions of social innovation proposed by scientific and research centers and various authors are extracted and grouped into three main categories of "purpose", "focus" and "nature." Content analysis method is used to identify the constituent concepts, dimensions and effective elements. And in order to validate the extracted concepts, Delphi panel method is used with the participation of a number of scholars and experts. At the end, the findings are presented as seven propositions about the concept of social innovation: "the idea of public goods and services", "governance and capacity building", "social entrepreneurship", "business strategy and organizational management", "new products, services and programs meeting social needs", "the processes of social change" and "institutional change."]]></dcterms:abstract>

The concept of health in an organization points to the conditions that facilitate growth and development or stimulate organizational dynamics. Organizational health is not only the organization's ability to function effectively, but to continuously improve the organization's ability to grow. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of organizational health on organizational entrepreneurship with an emphasis on the mediatory variable of creative climate. This study is a practical in purpose and descriptive-survey in nature and methodology. The statistical population of the study includes 280 employees of Iran Chemical Industrial Investment Company. A standard questionnaire is used to collect data. Its validity is tested and confirmed by AVE index, and its reliability by composite reliability and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Structural equation modelling is used to analyse the data in SmartPLS software. The results reveal that organizational health influences organizational entrepreneurship and creative climate. The results also show that creative climate influences organizational entrepreneurship significantly. On the other hand, it is revealed that creative climate can be considered as a mediating factor in the relationship between organizational health and organizational entrepreneurship.
