			<abstract>
			This study investigates the relationship between cultural intelligence and social capital. Since social capital is one of the most valuable assets of an organization and considered to have a critical role in corporate competitive advantage, reviewing its components seems necessary. Unfortunately in Iran, a country with variety of different cultures, the concept of cultural intelligence is still immature and most of people mistakenly consider cultural intelligence only as cultural differences. In this study we examine the relation between social capital and cultural intelligence as two important elements of human resource studies for the first time. To do so we have chosen staff of NIOPDC (National Iranian Oil Production Distribution Company) as our sample population .Results from different surveys in this company show that there is a positive and meaningful relationship between main variables of the study, Social Capital and Cultural Intelligence. This meaningful relation could be an appropriate guidance for human resource manageress and also can help strategists to find best solutions to improve staff cultural intelligence in such organizations and enjoy the accumulation of social capital as the result.

The present research focuses on evaluating the effects of learning processes on strategic innovation. Strategic innovation is about changing business models, creating markets without competition and a big surge of value proposition to customers.Learning processes entails explorative, assimilative, transformative, and exploitative processes. Through evaluating of our hypotheses, we came to the conclusion that Learning processes affect strategic innovation; exploitative learning is the only part of learning processes with no effect on strategic innovation. Also, combinative capabilities mediates the relationship between learning processes and strategic innovation. Research centers of Iran&#8217;s oil industry was the case study of this research

And in the design and development questions, comments professors were applied. Also Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaire. And obtained coefficient (92/3) showed that the questionnaire has good reliability. The results show that attitudes about knowledge sharing that the majority of the fund's employees (72 percent) have been positive terms about knowledge sharing.
