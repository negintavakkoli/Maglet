In order to fulfill the mentioned purpose, the key concepts of research and the theories related to the issue were studied. According to it, in order to collect the data, library method and note taking tool were used. The studies indicated the presence of human in the environment and the perceptions arising from physical-spatial structures, social-activity structures, individual-mental structures as the result of defining the meaning of environment convert the space&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;s environment to the place. This definition of meaning has led to the positioning of person in the face of place and it is effective on the quality and quantity of his presence at present and future in that special place. This positioning has been expressed in the frame of sense of place and according to this sense, linking the person with the place is formed. This sense can be equal more and less for a set of persons in the frame of social groups. Different levels from indifference-placelessness to awareness, dependency, affection, commitment and finally loyalty and sacrifice are determined for sense of place. The sense of place is effective on formation of individual and social identity by linking the person to the place and also the dependency sense to the place. The identity of place is also influenced by the sense of place. In other words, individual identity can be found in the special and unique features of him/her and also in the features of a society in which he has been present as a member of it. A place that person is present is also added to the mentioned phrase and therefore, the identity of human will be influenced by individual, social and spatial features. Therefore, it can be said that citizenship identity is influenced by the identity of place and in wider interpretation spatial identity or identity of city.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
