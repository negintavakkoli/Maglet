	<abstract language="eng">The success of a public urban space is in attraction of the citizens to itself. The climate conditions and the conditions of thermal comfort are factors affecting the usage pattern of pedestrians in public urban spaces. In general, awareness of sensory information and understanding of the complex process called the perception of them. Psychological aspects and its impact on the evaluation of thermal comfort make a different perception of thermal sensation. Adaptation is the most important psychological factors affecting thermal comfort perception. with the focus on functional factors, factors were evaluated in the case studies using inductive and deductive methods and survey studies. In the objective section, after collecting climate data required for urban areas studied and at different times of the day and in both the cold and warm seasons (January and July), analysis was performed. In the mental section, after extracting the studied variables such as personal characteristics, the reason and time of exposure, type and amount of activities, etc. the variables were assessed by observation, collaborative approachand using the views of pedestrians in the case studies. Then, a part of the results of questionnaire was analyzed in terms of causal relationships and correlation using SPSS software and another part was analyzed qualitatively. In order to prepare the questionnaire, some questions were set corresponding to each criterion. It was designed based on 5-option Likert scale. Reliability analysis and alpha coefficient were used to analyze the accuracy of the questions and to measure the level of appropriateness of the research tools. According to the Cochran formula, sample size was totally estimated 390 for both cold and warm seasons (the peak of cold and heat and lack of thermal comfort in Tehran Town) and both case studied. With the inclusion of some questionnaires with runtime errorsof thermal comfort and environmental psychology were asked to revise the questionnaire. 50 questionnaire were firstly considered as Pretest and then 150 questionnaires were filled out (that is, a total of 200 for the winter) and 200 other questionnaires were filled out in the summer. In the present study, case studies are two historical urban spaces located in the center of Tehran Town: Imam Khomeini (AS) Square) that named in this article&amp;rsquo;s analyzes as place 1) and Imam Hussain Square) that named in this article&amp;rsquo;s analyzes as place 2). Also, in Imam Hussain (AS) Square, there is a 17th Shahrivar walkway which is connected to the square and there is a Bab-e Homayun walkway in Imam Khomeini Square. Considering the emphasis on the conditions of thermal discomfort as the assumption of this research, two selected urban spaces were investigated during the times from 8:00 to 20:00 in the warmest and coldest days of the year. In present study, in summary, only 12:00 as the warmest day in summer (for Imam Khomeini Square) and 18:00 as the coldest day in winter (for Imam Hossein Square) were presented as a spatial examples and in the form of thermal comfort simulation maps. Because at these times, the intensity of heat and cold increases (due to the sun radiation). Also , In order to evaluate physical adaptation, the responses examined, in both warm and cold seasons, leaving the space in the later place is more compared to the former place. Since this factor is influenced by thermal adaption, it emphasizes the superiority of the former place on the second one in terms of thermal adaptation. It should be noted that in the first place where street restaurants exist, people have easy access to food and drink after a feeling of discomfort, but there are fewer such facilities in the second place. As a conclusion it should be noted that the main objective of present study is:&amp;nbsp; to change urban planners&amp;rsquo; perspective from prioritizing physical comfort (whether thermal comfort of its other types such as light, smell, visual comfort, etc.) to promoting psychological aspects of environment.

In most of these countries, the urban planning and management system is centralized And monitoring and development of cities through government agencies at the local and national levels Despite the many challenges and barriers, strengthening local governments and attracting private sector participation is an essential element. With the inability of the government in Tehran to respond to various urban needs and the lack of compliance with citizens' priorities with the plans and the need for more accountability in the administration of urban affairs, Today, a model of city administration is proposed based on the new attitude of urban governance to these countries. Which calls not only the government, but also the civil society and the private sector to participate in the city administration. The research methodology is descriptive-analytic And has been collecting information using documentary and library methods. The statistical population of this study is Tehran municipality managers Using multi-stage random sampling method, due to the wide range of statistical population And the information provided has been analyzed using Tapsis method Based on the result of that measure of communication between people and the plan, the cost reduction and implementation time of the projects has ranked first.

	<abstract language="eng">Nowadays, military threats are becoming more important as a form of new tools. A review of public places with passive defense approach shows that the existence of underground places is essential for enforcing the military forces of country. Designing these places is roughly difficult because of their unique mental and psychological characteristics. These places need to a level of livability to maintain. The main goal of this article is to explore the important variables of livability in safe underground spaces. The research method in this article is based on survey analysis and uses deep interviews with professors and specialists at this domain. According to the grounded theory approach, an axis coding is done and the results are gathered by means of this technique. The findings of this paper show that professors have emphasized on five categories of visual-physical, perceptual, environmental, functional and social. Also, they indicated twenty one factors which are effective on livability of underground public spaces in Tehran. Finally, some solutions are recommended.

It is a factor that causes the transformation of a space into a particular sense of sense and behavior for specific individuals. in addition to having a sense of comfort from the environment, the sense of place has supported the cultural concepts of the people, social and cultural relations of the community in a given location and brings back past experience and the recognition of identity for individuals. Since space is an effective factor in distinguishing the environment from architecture, it is physically, an environment with a clear character, and can be more successful in creating a sense of place. Due to the importance of this sense in enhancing the quality of the designed space, this study examines the concept of location and effective factors in the city of Khuzestan province and the physical effects and cognitive factors of users affect the feeling of people in space. at first, it means the sense of place and its concept from different perspectives and finally presents the different levels and shape factors and finally presents a model for showing how these factors affect the effects of these factors.

	<abstract language="eng">In recent years, number of sustainable buildings has been increased in different countries. In Iran, sustainable architecture design and construction have gradually improved over the years as well. However, there is a need to review the current quality of the residential spaces in environment oriented buildings and to improve conditions, taking into account the perceptions, experiences and preferences of their inhabitants. Failure to provide a suitable space for social interaction and the lack of respect for the residents' taste in the design has a significant impact on the comfort level of residents. Hence, this study aims to cover the research objectives in two stages: Firstly to evaluate the quality of the residents' experiences in both private individual units indoors and common spaces of the buildings and secondly to identify environmental design according to the residents&amp;rsquo; preferences. It is also worth to mention that the scope of this research was on four environmental oriented residential buildings in Tehran. To proceed with this research, 204 questionnaires were distributed in these four residential buildings. The analysis process was implemented by the ChiSQ and AVALUE programs in the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) statically tool. The researcher is trying to expand the sustainable concept in all aspects of sustainability consistent with environmental issues and developments in building technology. The purpose of this quantitative research, as mentioned above, is to collect information through the study of previous literature as well as access to new information according to questionnaires designed in the research process. The results indicate the significant demand of residents in order to improve the existing facilities towards social interactive between individual units. The research has positive effect on residential buildings changes with an environmental approach; also it could increase the knowledge of existing and future researchers in the country.

	<abstract language="eng">It is the first step ahead of practical action to train, define its goals, and adapt the contents of classroom practical programs and the process of training in architecture lessons and in particular design courses. In order to measure the efficiency of any educational content, it is possible to provide the results of the training experience of these subjects during the creative learning experience of architecture. Accordingly, in this paper, creative training is based on the creative indices of creativity (fluid, development, innovation, and flexibility) in architectural design lessons. The present research method is a combination of the method of descriptive - analytic and the practical based on the methods of creative learning in the world in a population of students of free Islamic university architecture. In order to determine the effectiveness of the creative process of creativity to architectural students, two tests were used; one of the evaluation of creativity which was used as a criterion for measuring the simultaneous narrative of creativity of Torrance creativity. In this paper, we study the concept of general education in particular, and then in an analytical approach, to the category of methods and models of training in architecture. In the end, some models and training patterns are presented in this regard. Also, the training experience of these subjects is presented in the form of research - based learning based on the creativity test of abedi and Torrance, and some results in the direction of creative training in architecture are mentioned.

	<abstract language="eng">The city is a collection of living and dynamic elements whose identity has fluctuated over time and transmitted to later periods. The city grows over time and interacts with citizens, and the city's mirror image is the image of citizens and the creator of the creative spirit of the inhabitants. With the onset of capitalism, and especially over the last two centuries, and the emergence of issues such as globalization, the form of production and lifestyle of the urban population have changed, and tissue changes and congestion in its current form have emerged. In recent decades, changing the concept of city content, increasing urban populations, and criticizing the lack of development and the development of low density cities, high-profile policies have been planned as a strategy for new approaches. The widespread use of this method gradually extended to residential areas in addition to economic uses such as industrial, administrative and commercial use, and extended to peripheral areas of the city. On the other hand, in a country like Iran, which has an old pattern in the field of architecture and urbanization, and the city is a set of homogeneous and homogeneous neighborhoods that, based on the appropriate relationships, form and ethnic, religious, occupational or territorial affiliations in a specific place of the complex They have been keeping their guides and authenticity for years; the rise of high profile activities has raised concerns and concerns over the past years, and these concerns can become serious and even critical issues. The methodology of this research is qualitative and its approach is descriptive and analytical. The purpose of this research is to promote and create social cohesion in high-rise residential complexes utilizing osteopenia elements and physical structure as the basis for implementation of urban design of base participation. By reviewing the texts of architecture and urbanism, it seems that some people believe that urban development of the present cannot be seen in the past urbanization and development of the past, but a group of contemporary experts have tried to use the legacy of architecture and urban planning in their works. Consistency and coherence are considered as one of the main criteria for the quality of urban spaces. Traditional and indigenous spaces were mostly of such quality. Nowadays, both practical and theoretically, urban spaces and science related to environmental design are facing a major challenge. In terms of data processing, Delphi's technique is based on its analytical model based on procedural unity in experts' opinions. The main result of this research is the extraction of the socio-social coherence criteria of the Iranian neighborhood from the perspective of experts and prioritizing these criteria to implement and establish the indicators of social and physical coherence with the urban design approach of participatory basis in high-rise residential complexes and promotion of participation and social status in these collections.

	<abstract language="eng">Changes in the urban spatial structure originate from a variety of factors that one of them is urbanization. Urbanization is measurable with two categories of population and employment. The population is not distributed uniformly in the city; but depending on the circumstances follows different patterns. Also, the factor of the population, along with other spatial parameters, is the source of the creation of secondary nuclei and also affects the spatial distribution of employment. In this research, the main goal of the study is to investigate demographic changes and activity centers as spatial distribution in Ardabil. In this research, with quantitative, descriptive and analytical methods, the spatial patterns process of population and employment patterns have been investigated. The data used for demographic analysis were census data from 1390 and 1395. But for the study of the spatial distribution of employment, were used from data commercial and service uses for the years 1385 and 1390 the comprehensive plan of the city of Ardabil.

	<abstract language="eng">Disposal of urban waste contains pollutants whose quantity and diversity multiplies every day. This process, while requiring appropriate management, should be done in a way that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, after considering the quantity and quality of waste in the 15th district of Tehran and its current disposal method, four scenarios were considered studying the facilities, recycling, compost, and also a reduction of 5% of waste materials from the source. Then the scenarios were analyzed in terms of the production and emission of greenhouse gases using the IWM model. The results indicate that recycling and compost facilities play a significant role in reducing the greenhouse gases. By reducing 5% of waste per year, 401.66 tons of CH4 + NOx and 6132.36 tons of CO2 gas have been decreased on average in one year.In general, it can be argued that the use of facilities such as recycling and compost, as well as using the principle of reduction from the source by culture-building for the general public, can reduce environmental problems and in particular lower the greenhouse gas emissions.

	<abstract language="eng">The choice of materials is one of the major challenges in contemporary architecture. As far as the criteria of present buildings are present, limits are considered to choose and apply it. The arrival of various materials in the country requires the indigenous - aesthetic basis of it. For in case of neglect of this, the original face of the cities will grow more turbulent. This study examines the ecological basis and its adaptation to personality theories tries to explore local - personality differences and use different materials. The question of the research can be suggested: How is the difference between different personalities in choosing, processing and applying materials, and how did selected monuments find? Since the ornamentation is also important as a factor to explore the differences in the use of materials, the difference of personalities in the selection of ornamentation is also addressed. The method of research in the creation and structure of theoretic bases, logical reasoning, and in inferring the difference between material and ornamentation originated from the diversity of native characters. in this study , based on the basis of reasoning, the land of canvas causes the thinker, the moisture causes sensation and perception, the cold, and heat cause an introvert to become an introvert. Basic personality introspection is the use of natural materials, making a difference in the appearance of materials, the use of monochrome materials, and lack of interest in indexing materials. A basic personality Extraversion is a welcome to new materials, use of materials to diversify or modify materials color and make distinctions between different parts according to changes in type or arrangement of materials. to be thoughtful and judgment in the base personality causes uncertainty in the choice of materials, the use of textured materials on the side of the smooth materials, the tendency to show the geometrical arrangement of materials by making clarity on the boundary of parts and components. The perception of the basis of the basic personality causes risk taking in the use of new materials, the tendency of to work, the use of natural or less processed materials, the use of material with little contrast in color and texture.

	<abstract language="eng">the development of different urban dimensions in recent years and the prevalence of new urban development has also affected urban tissues, and today, the urban areas, especially the regions and regions in particular, face complex problems such as the sense of spatial belonging and urban identity, and their socio - spatial status decline is increasing. Therefore, urban landscape and aspect is an important and even challenging issue among urban planning pundits, architecture and environmental design, in a way that the lack of single literature has even led to. on the other hand, most studies concerning the location and issues related to it, including the sense of place in the field of cognitive psychology and education, is not sufficient in urban planning, and it must be designed to make sense for the people and create a region for the shape of mass events by creating public spaces with the quality and optimal conditions among construction density. In this paper, we refer to the principles and criteria of landscape design in order to update the sense of location, and at the end of conceptual and contextual principles in designing the urban landscape to enhance the sense of place and belonging to place.

	<abstract language="eng">Spatial-social segregation is one of the fundamental subjects of urban sociologists and planners. Economic, social, political and physical factors are such factors which contribute the creation and fortification of social-spatial segregation in neighborhood of metropolitans. In this article has been tried to calculate the amount of social-spatial segregation in the Educational, Income, Occupational, and Ethnic Groups. Hence, the studies about segregation have been surveyed at first. By resorting the related theories and studies, applied indices for calculating the amount of segregation have been defined. Collected data from questionnaire has been applied in SPSS software and the census of 2011 are entered in Excel. After that both of them are matched by MATLAB software in one Excel. Thereafter, the Excel export in GIS software has been attached to the map. Finally, the Social-Spatial Segregation amount of Educational, Income, Occupational, and Ethnic Groups has been calculated by Geo Segregation Analyzer software. Kerman neighborhood in 8th region of Tehran Municipality have been issued as a case study and their amount of segregation has been calculated for them. In this study, the dependent variable is the amount of spatial-social segregation and the independent variable contains the items below:

- Individual-familial characteristics: level of education, career, job position, ethnic character, and amount of income.

According to the obtained results from Geo Segregation Analyzer software, it can be stated that socio-spatial segregation between groups of employees is very high. Especially segregation amount in employers group is very high and near 1. It means that complete segregation is appeared in this group. Moreover, the segregation amount in educational groups is medium or high. The segregation of ethnic groups is more than average and high. Lor and Turk people are segregated from other ethnic groups. The amount of segregation for them is high. However, the segregation of Fars people is very low. The factors show that the amount of scio-spatial segregation in this neighborhood is high. The residents aren&amp;rsquo;t similar to each other and they want to be segregated. So the city manager should solve this problem by suitable policies that are helpful for this neighborhood.
