The theory of dynamic capabilities has been presented over the past two decades as a supplemental resource-based view to help us understand how to develop resources of an organization over the time and how to maintain a competitive advantage. In this article we have tried to present a conceptual model of  the most impressive capabilities related to the resources re-configuration of dynamic capabilities that have significant impact on improving construction companies performance. Research models using data collected from 97 construction companies in the PLS software were analyzed. The results based on the structural equation modeling method reveals that learning capability as one dimension of internal resources re-configuration  has the most  impact on performance of construction companies.</field></doc></add>
