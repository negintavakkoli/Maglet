In terms of its purpose, the method is a combination of the phenomenological method in the quantitative part and descriptive-correlation method, in the quantitative part of research. The statistical population of the research in the qualitative section has been ۳۹ people including: close-to-retirement (۱۵ people) , during retirement (۸ people) and retirees (۱۶ people). Snowball method has been used until reaching saturation of information. The population of research in the quantitative section for close to retirement stage was ۱۱۵, for retirement stage, ۳۰ persons and for after retirement stage was ۱۱۷۵ people. The sample size was ۹۲, ۲۸ and ۲۸۵, respectively, based on random sampling for each of these three groups. The data collection tool was semi-structured interview in the qualitative part and the questionnaire, in the quantitative part of research. Validity of the questionnaires was reviewed by using content validity-contextual validity as well as structural validity. The reliability of the questionnaires was calculated through Cronbach's alpha, which was calculated for all three questionnaires above ۰٫۸ which indicates their good reliability. In order to analyze the data in the qualitative section, the ۷-step quantitative method of Colaizzi was used and in the quantitative part, statistical tests such as factor analysis, mean and variance test, cross-sectional test and model quality test were used. Finally, dimensions and components of our model were identified and confirmed for close-to-retirement (concerns, expectations, and expectations) during retirement (concerns, needs and motives, expectations) and for after-retirement (challenges, expectations, personal strategies). </field></doc></add>
