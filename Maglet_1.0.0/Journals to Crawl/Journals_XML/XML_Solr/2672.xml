<add><doc><field name="journal_id">10014</field><field name="abstract">This study aimed to identify the cognitive differences between expert and novice managers in the performance of their main tasks by examining their perspectives and experiences. To do so, two four-people groups of experts and novice managers, from two subsidiaries of National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company were selected. A task analysis interview was conducted for every participant and the data was encoded by Crandall, Klein, and Hoffman’s (۲۰۰۶) guideline and the two groups were compared together. The results revealed various cognitive differences between the two groups. Most importantly, expert managers considered probabilities, obtained the approval of others for their decisions, and paid attention to the importance of workforce. These cognitive differences can help organizations hire qualified managers, identify weaknesses in the performance of managers, and train managers.</field></doc></add>
