Compilation of administrative plans and implementation of strategies is almost among the concerns of the managers and programmers. Deduction of plans from development master and minor plans is too much time-consuming. Moreover, areas of activity and types of medium for tourism are extremely various therefore, in many tourism centers, development programmers compile criteria and indices calling them tourism per capita. In this article, attempts have been made to compile some of the more related per capita to tourism industry.

Today human is engaged with a great crisis as a result of his unbalancing the life, neglecting indigenous and environmental factors, and hegemonic behavior toward nature. This has ended to creation of an approach called sustainable development whose main aims are to meet the essential needs, improvement of life quality, and better management of ecosystems. Obviously it is meaningless to discuss sustainability and sustainable development in the absence of cities and urban life. Cities are counted for as the main reasons for unsustainability the world over, however urban sustainability and global sustainability are the same concepts.  Therefore, knowing key elements to reach this station is necessary, whereas recognition and prioritization of effective key elements in sustainable development is strategic and entails economic, social, and health-related results in the sequence of time. The current study is descriptive-analytic in which attempts have been made to estimate the importance of main indices of sustainable development based on the opinions of elites using a fuzzy hierarchical analysis process technic. Analysis of the data shows that from among main indices, urban health, desirable governmental system, and sustainable environment are respectively of the highest importance.

Also transformations in the governments role in management of societies’ affairs, has given rise to the budget planning and financial management alterations. Increase in “economic efficiency”, “efficiency”, and “effectiveness” of budget, increases responsible persons’ responsiveness versus their more power in decision-making, leading governments to be convinced to implement such an order. Existence of  a master budget law, defining and ratification of aims and activities of different organs if the government by the law-makers considering the rule of law, implementing auditing order based on performance, giving enough power to the legislative assembly, and government’s reciprocity, are all legal bases for to implement administrative budget planning, which are studied in this article while they are not completely met in the country’s provisions because of structural and legal problems.

Identity and neighborhood-based cultural and historical architectural design and construction of the most important topics in the field of Genealogy of analysis in the era of globalization and technological development requires consistent feedback and interaction architecture, style and technology is If, today, the application of scientific knowledge in the design and architecture of the city is one of the tools of modern urban planning. The rapid advancement of technology and its impact on the construction of cities and towns can change the orientation of technological determinism and simple as a habitual behavior has been dominant. Lack of coordination requires the use of technology in the fields of architecture and identity oriented architecture that has been mentioned in this article. This study was conducted analytical and logical reasoning Analysis of Data and Documents library studies benefited. The results of this study suggest that the use of modern technologies in construction, infrastructure compatibility and similarity of culture and identity is of utmost importance. Because the complexity of manufacture and urban architecture shows that technology is the foundation and basis for the structure of the city Although it helps to build the architecture and the city, but only to provide adequate facilities and various and diverse needs of not culture and identity. Public understanding of science and intelligent use of technology in dealing with identity, with emphasis on the historical background, cultural, social and environmental impact will be on understanding and explaining urban phenomenon.

One type of social dilemmas is giving priority to the interests of individual or collectivity. If one ask 'why citizens prefer their individual interests to collective interests when they face conflict between them?', we can identify incidence and prevalence of disorders at different phases of the social body as possible influencing factors. Analytically, the collective interests is partitioned into three level (family, neighbors, citizens) based on hierarchy of structural inclusion and each of them is partitioned into the four phases based on Parsons AGIL framework (Adaptation, Goal Attainment, Integration, and Latency). Relying on extensive theoretical discussions, the factors affecting the priority of individual interests over collective interests were diagnosed according to the collective interests at all levels and phases of the study. 400 Zanjan citizens who were selected with disproportionate sampling method answered to structured questionnaire items about the quantity of the mentioned factors. Results showed that 48 percent of variations in the primacy of the individual interests over private interests are predicted by four identified factors (normative disorders, relational disorders, lack of self-regulation, and the lack of identification). At first, the &quot;normative disorder&quot; and then &quot;relational disorders&quot; are effective factors in increasing the priority of individual interests over collective interests, especially in the &quot;urban&quot; are.

Beliefs and ritual pervasive role in the transformation of urban spaces on the one hand, and their reliability and durability on the other hand, have had. If today we can influence the structure and configuration of beliefs and ritual observed. On the other hand, the mourning and quite over time in the context of cultural and physical structure existed as a cultural element is eternal and everlasting.

The findings show that there is a spiritual sense of the sacred and especially the ideas in each area, and the complex biological environment of the neighborhood and the neighborhood villages and cities can help to &quot;eternal&quot; and the space environment and sustainable development of the place and is eternal. &quot;Sense of place&quot; to &quot;settings&quot; it depends. The relationship between the three levels of meaning as &quot;syntactic meaning&quot;, &quot;meaning of the concept&quot; and &quot;functional significance&quot; can be outlined: (A) - &quot;means the way&quot; to the location of the Hosseine in the city such as grammar points. (B)- &quot;conceptual level&quot; means the norms, values and attitudes that are offering rooms, that can be the result of people's beliefs and convictions Shiite leader of the free world to the server and Imam Hussein. (C)- &quot;functional significance&quot; to the users of the Tkaya and exploit the people will.

Unfortunately, most of the cities without regard to principles of passive defense designed and planned. On the other hand there is a wide range of military threats and valuable resources in the country have caused more and more attention is focused on passive defense approach. It is important to rebuild their destroyed cities with the approach of passive defense is impossible. But this would not stop the application of these principles in urban planning and urban design in the country. It is necessary to extract the principles of architecture and urban planning approach based on passive defense of the status quo option be considered. The aim of this approach is the extraction of urban cellular design principles consistent with the needs and specific circumstances of the country's passive defense to the field of new settlements and towns in the country's stability.
