			<abstract>In recent years, intellectual capital has always been regarded as an important resource for an organization to develop, grow, and achieve a sustainable competitive edge. Using data analysis, the present study look for designing a suitable model for managing intellectual capital in the Iranian Army. To investigate this field study the researchers have collected the data through questionnaires and interviews; to do this, 36 interviews were conducted with 19 professors teaching management at AJA universities, and a paradigmatic model was offered using theorems based on the extracted concepts from the intellectual capital indexes. “Human resource quality”, “human resources quantity”, and “organizational economic outlook” were identified as the components of “moving toward a knowledge-based economy” as the causal condition. In addition, in this model “Intellectual capital” (class orientation) and “organizational communication” (intervening factors) have affected interactive and reactive strategies. The sub-components include “culture”, “social capital”, “information infrastructure”, and “organizational capital”. “Competitive Advantage” is the consequence of the “motivational factors of job sustainability&quot;”, “developmental social capital”, “new phenomenon risk management”, “effective management in an organization”, “value orientation and idealism”, “creating effective organizational awareness”, “organizational resource development”, “cost management”, “employee satisfaction”, and “human resource efficiency”.</abstract>

			<abstract>Organizational Cynicism is a new concept in organizational behavior and organizational psychology that attracts the attention of the organizational theorists. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of workplace ostracism on organizational cynicism by moderating psychological capital in the military industry. The research is applied in terms of its purpose and in terms of its nature and method, it is a descriptive-survey of a correlational type. The statistical population consisted of the military industry employees (310) in Tehran, where a sample of 170 people was selected using Cochran’s formula with 5% error margin through simple random sampling method. A standard Likert-scale questionnaire was used to collect the data. The Cronbach’s alpha for the questionnaire of workplace ostracism was 0.907, and for organizational cynicism and psychological capital questionnaires, they were 0.938 and 0.918 respectively. To analyze the research data, structural equation modeling (using Smart-Pls software) was used. The results showed that workplace ostracism has a positive and significant effect on organizational cynicism. In addition, psychological capital moderates the relationship between workplace ostracism and organizational cynicism.</abstract>

			<abstract>Military intelligence units due to their activity in complex and turbulent environments are in need to use approaches such as human resource flexibility, organizational intelligence   and organizational ambidexterity to fulfill their mission. Therefore, due to the importance of the relationships among these variables with information excellence, the present study has been carried out with the aim of investigating the mediating role of human resource flexibility in the relationship between organizational ambidexterity and organizational intelligence in two military intelligence units. In terms of the purpose, it is an applied research, and considering data collection, it is a descriptive survey. The correlation between variables, however, was based on structural equation modeling.  The population of the study consisted of 68 high-ranking commanders and managers of two military intelligence units. To collect the data, Johnson’s organizational ambidexterity questionnaire, Wright and Snell’s human resource flexibility questionnaire and Albrecht’s organizational intelligence questionnaire with the objectives, duties and mission of the target organization were revised and modified. The validity of the questionnaires was confirmed by expert opinions and the reliability was confirmed using Cronbach’s alpha. The results show that despite the lack of support for the direct impact of organizational intelligence on organizational ambidexterity, organizational intelligence through human resource flexibility affects organizational ambidexterity.</abstract>

			<abstract>Research in logistics management and distribution planning has a similar approach to location inventory components such as order quantity, inventory storage reliability, and demand response. The major aim of this study is decision making in military logistic issues, whereby locating support centers, minimizing problem costs and delivering cargo to anticipated areas, leading to maximum satisfaction of the units through the level of service. This study investigates location and inventory of support units under dynamic and uncertain conditions in three-level mathematics: supporting areas as the first level, supporting units and distribution centers as the second level, and units as the third units. The problem is to determine the number and location of support unit (storages) and their current inventory alongside the allocation of the units or direct support unit (fixed or mobile) to provide the required cargos so that while reducing the cost in the shortest possible time for agility, effective, and scientific support is performed by increasing satisfaction. Therefore, all units in each time period can be supported completely with at least the minimum level of acceptance. The proposed model is a multi-cargo, multi-period one in uncertain conditions of demand and costs. In addition, the proposed fuzzy approach model was analyzed using a robust possibilistic programing through proposing a novel fuzzy index (Me), a developed impact factor, and GAMS 24 software.</abstract>

			<abstract>Securing the holy government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its territorial integrity, and interests require the recognition of the especial needs of future wars and jihadi management to achieve these goals. Significant factors in this path are technology and technological empowerment of human capital in using it. The aim of this study is to conceptualize and explain the antecedents and consequences of technological empowerment of human capital in the universities of the defense sector (the case study: Imam Ali University). The study is an explanatory mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) investigation. In the qualitative phase, based on grounded theory, the content and its significant dimensions were extracted. The questionnaire findings of the qualitative study were examined and confirmed in the quantitative phase through factor analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the Friedman’s classification. The findings show that the antecedents of technological empowerment of human capital are organizational infrastructure, organizational culture, work relations, commitment, and organizational support. The factors of technological empowerment of human capital are research and development, technological assessment and acquisition, technology implementation, creativity and innovation, learning, and the attraction of foreign technology and connection, while the consequences of technological empowerment of human capital are personal development and growth, organizational development, efficiency, competitive advantage creation, personnel empowerment, change management, information security management, decentralization, and Participatory management.</abstract>

			<abstract>The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of implementation of logistic implementation based on cloud computing technology in a defense organization. The present research is qualitative and cross sectional. The statistical population of the study consisted of all the personnel and commanders of Logistics and Information and Communication Technology from defense units of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran. Using random sampling method and Cochran’s formula, 197 people were selected as the sample. In order to collect the data, the questionnaire was revised and modified according to the objectives, tasks and mission of the target organization. The validity of the questionnaire was based on expert opinions and its reliability was confirmed using Cronbach’s alpha. Based on the normally distributed data, the analysis was performed using parametric tests (One Sample t Test and Friedman). The results show that despite the desirability of the ability and acceptance dimensions in authority related fields, the minimum necessary conditions for the implementation of cloud computing technology are not provided in the organization’s objective logistics.</abstract>
