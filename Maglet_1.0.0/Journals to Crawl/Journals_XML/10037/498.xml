Introduction
Considering the fact that the estimation of mode &#160;fracture toughness by testing is time-consuming and expensive. It might be associated with certain practical difficulties. Therefore, many researchers have attempted to propose experimental relationships in order to capture these problems. Gunsallus et al. (1984) and Bhagat (1985) experimentally found that mode &#160;fracture toughness is related to tensile strength. Whittaker et al. (1992) have also proposed a number of relationships between mode I fracture toughness, tensile strength, point load index, uniaxial compressive strength and the velocity of sound waves. Bearman (1999) obtained an experimental relationship between mode I fracture toughness and point load index, while Brown et al. (1997) presented an experimental relationship between this parameter and density. Up to now no significant research effort has been made in this field in Iran, only Ayatollahi and Fatehi addressed rock fracture toughness. Although, Ayatollahi has not presented any experimental relationships. In the present research the three-point bending test was used on a cylindrical specimen containing a straight crack in order to determine the mode &#160;fracture toughness, and the Brazilian test was employed to determine tensile strength.
Materials and Methods
The tests were carried out on six types of rocks, namely gray sandstone,
tuff, lithic tuff, travertine, andesite, and limestone. Sandstone, travertine, and limestone are sedimentary rocks, while andesite is an extrusive igneous rock, and tuff and lithic tuff are pyroclastic rocks (pyroclastic rocks resulting from volcanic eruptions that harden by sedimentation). Therefore, the studied rocks have different origins. In order to carry out the Brazilian and the three-point bending test, cores were prepared from these blocks. In order to perform the three-point bending test, specimens with diameter of 73 mm with a thickness of 30 mm were used. The samples were cut in two semicircular by a cutting machine, and a notch with length of 15 mm is created by a diamond saw.&#160; Notch is vertical in the center of the semicircular samples.
The Brazilian test was performed on disc shaped specimens. In order to perform the Brazilian test, specimens with diameter of 51 mm and thick of 25 mm were used. The specimens are carefully placed under the curved jaws of the machine and then loaded until fracture.
Results and Discussion
A summary of the Brazilian and the three-point bending test results are presented in Table 1. The average value of test result pertaining to each rock is reported in Table 1.

In this study, it was attempted to propose an experimental relationship between mode I fracture toughness and the tensile strength of the rock.
In order to determine the relationship between the tensile strength and the fracture toughness, the tensile strength vs. fracture toughness diagram was plotted in Excel to obtain Eq. 1 and the coefficient of determination (R2) (Figure 1).

The coefficient of determination (R2) in Eq. 1 shows that almost 80 percent of the mode I fracture toughness variations can be estimated using the linear relationship (Eq. 1). The relationship is applicable for determining the mode I fracture toughness resulting from the three-point bending test on semicircular specimens containing a straight crack.

In the following, the results of this study are compared to those reported by Whittacker (1992) and Zhang (2002).
In order to examine the accuracy of the presented relationships, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measure was used which is computed from Eq. 2. In the best case, RMSE is zero.&#160;

In the relationships, &#160; represents the fracture toughness obtained from testing while &#160;is the fracture toughness estimated using the relationships. 
Comparison of the obtained results indicate that the proposed relationship has the capability of precise estimation of the mode I fracture toughness of rocks.
Conclusion 
Given the many difficulties associated with the direct estimation of fracture toughness, indirect estimation methods have been proposed. One of such methods is the estimation of mode I fracture toughness using tensile strength. A linear relationship with a coefficient of determination of 0.7977 was proposed. The accuracy of this relationship has been verified by comparing its results to those from previous studies.

Introduction
In weak soils with low bearing capacity, the load transfer is done using piles. Therefore, by creating an interposed layer separating the pile from the raft, reactions between raft and pile head will be reduced and the load-bearing role of shallow soil will be more than contact pile situation. Normally, the pile head and shallow soil have a settlement equal to the raft. Thus, the relative settlement of pile and soil in pile head is equal to zero and at the bottom is high and the body friction mobilizes upward. In addition, a portion of load is tolerated by shallow soil and the other portion is tolerated by the pile head, which would be transferred to deeper soil layers. In noncontact state, with the formation of a hard soil layer on which the raft is located, soil mechanical parameters will be improved; while in contact state, the settlement will be decreased by reducing the amount of transferred load to the shallow soil. The transferred load to the shallow soil increases vertical and horizontal stress around piles, so bearing capacity of piles is increased.
Methodology
In this study, a parametric study has been performed concerning contact and noncontact piles using finite element software namely, ABAQUS/CAE software version 6.13.1 and the obtained results were compared (with what? The sentence is incomplete). Thus, simulations are is done for states of 0, 1, 4 and 9 piles for each of the contact and noncontact piles (total of 8 simulations). In the present research two models were taken to investigate the optimum mesh sizes, 12 models for parametric studies on parameters of piles&#8217; length, piles&#8217; diameter, thickness of the raft and interposed layer and one model for verification study. Models in both contact and noncontact have been considered with a one meter interposed layer. Raft width and thickness were selected 7.5 and 1.6 m, respectively. Width and depth of the soil mass used in the model were 32 and 26 m, respectively, and the distance between the bottom of the pile and the soil mass was 13 m. In all cases, the diameter of piles was 0.5 m and distance between piles were 5 and 2.5 m in 4 and 9 states, respectively. The geotechnical parameters and model dimensions used, were selected according to the Fioravante &#38; Girettis (2010) [1]. Sand and silica-sand with the defined properties were used for the soil mass and the interposed layer, respectively. Since Drucker-Prager criteria has better ability to express the behavior of coarse-grained soils, this criterion was used in the modeling [2]. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of interposed layer on bearing capacity and settlement of pile. Hence, because of simplifying the process of modeling, parameters of main soil and interposed layer are mostly similar. Piles and raft are made of concrete with an elasticity modulus of 21 GPa, Poisson's ratio of 0.2 and density of 2300 kg/m3. The crack growth analysis with the compressive stress-plastic strain was used to express the fracture behavior of concrete [2, 3 &#38; 4]. In the present study, frictional and vertical contacts between surfaces were considered for conducting interactions between different materials. For frictional contact, the penalty formulation with the fixed friction coefficient of tan&#948; was used where &#948; is the angle of friction. The penalty formulations and hard contact were applied between two surfaces for the normal contact. Interactions were considered in the modeling including raft-soil mass, raft-interposed layer, pile-raft, interposed layer-soil mass, interposed layer-pile and the soil-pile [5 &#38; 6]. Coefficient of soil lateral pressure used in this study corresponds to k0=0.65 which is introduced in many geotechnical conditions [7]. A uniform distributed vertical load 500 kPa was applied on the raft. For getting results in every portion of loading time, this amount is applied in order of 5 kPa in each time interval. To accelerate the process of analysis and because of the symmetry of all models in two directions of X and Y, the quarter model technique was used, so that movements in the direction perpendicular to the sheet and rotation around perpendicular axes on the sheet were not allowed on the border of symmetry. The boundaries of the models due to the enough distance from the piles were considered in a way that lateral displacement and rotation around the vertical axis was not allowed. Furthermore, the bottom of the soil mass was considered as complete fix due to the enough distance from the pile foot.
Conclusion
In this research, a numerical &#8211; parametric study is performed on special kind of piles named noncontact piles and results are compared with contact piles. Results of this study can be summarized as follows:
1. By increasing the number of piles from 1 to 9, the settlement reduced more in a noncontact state showing more effectiveness of implementing 9 contactpiles and thus requiring more piles in this case.
2. Soil surface stress differences in noncontacts states from 4 to 9 piles was less than contact state (approximately 1/7) indicating that more piles is needed to conduct the contact state.
3. Stress changes in the soil under the pile in noncontact state by adding piles from 1 to 4 was higher than adding piles from 4 to 9 indicating the suitability of using 4 noncontact piles; while, in the contact state, the stress changes in the soil under the pile in both cases from 1 to 4 piles and from 4 to 9 piles was noteworthy showing the necessity of using the ninth pile.
4. Unlike the states of 4 and 9 piles, the negative friction in noncontact state and 1 pile was seen along the piles, which can be due to the fewer piles and the effect of interposed layer density as well as soil mass at greater depthsbecause of lesser effect of piles in load-bearing.
5. The ratio of heads load in the contact to the noncontact piles was about 2.5 to 4 reflecting the positive impact of using interposed layer on load reduction and smaller cross-layer design for piles. In addition, the ratio of heads load in the contact to the noncontact piles was higher for 4 piles than 9 piles that represented the suitability of using 4 piles.
6. Based on the results of geometric parametric studies it is found that:
(A) By resizing the elements from 0.25 to 0.5 m, the results had not changed and only time of analysis was increased.
(B) Among three values of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 m for interposed layer thicknesses, the thickness of 1 m was enough and had a good effect on the stress distribution and involving shallow soil in bearing vertical stress.
(C) The raft thickness of 1.6 m was appropriate so that with this thickness, the resultant effect of increasing vertical loads (raft weight) and increased rigidity due to increased raft thickness caused the stress and settlements remain in a reasonable range.
(D) Due to the increased friction by increasing in diameter, the optimal diameter of 0.5 m was achieved for piles which reduced the settlement by receiving more load.
(E) Among three pile lengths of 10, 19 and 25 m, the optimal length was 19 m; so that by further increase in the length, stresses and settlements were not noticeably changed.In total, noncontact piles had better performance compared to contact piles in similar conditions.

Introduction
Soil nails are traditionally designed with uniform length and equal spacing to stabilize slopes which do not meet safety requirements. However, nails with uniform layout in a slope may not be the optimal design if the construction cost is taken into account. The optimal layouts lead to a minimum usage of nails and satisfies the allowable factor of safety and wall deformation.
In this study a decreasing trend of nails length along the wall height was considered to investigate the stability and the performance of the wall in different nail patterns. Then nail density was introduced as an important factor on the overall stability and deformation of the wall. It can be beneficial in the preliminary estimation of the required nail length at the beginning of a project.
Findings of this study are helpful for effective design of soil&#8211;nailed slopes.
Materials and Methods
The finite element analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of nails pattern on the overall stability and deformation of soil&#8211;nailed walls. Slope/W software was used to obtain the Factor of safety and Plaxis 2D was used to calculate the deformation of the soil nail walls. Soil hardening model was used to simulate the behavior of soil. In this study, various walls with different specifications were modeled and analyzed. As an example, a 10 m deep soil nail wall with C=10 kN/m2, ?=25 deg, Eoed=20000 kN/m2 is discussed here to monitor the trends (C represents cohesion, ? is the angle of friction and Eoed is the modulus of elasticity of the soil).
As it is shown in Figure 1, by considering the decreasing trend of nail length along the wall height, an ordered arrangement (pattern) is introduced by presenting &#8220;L&#8221; as the base nail length and &#8220;&#8221; as the inclination of stabilized zone border then, the effect of nail arrangement on the safety factor and deformation of nailed wall is investigated. The nails were installed with an angle of 15 degrees relative to the horizon. According to FHWA a minimum value of 1.35 is considered for the factor of safety. Circular failure surfaces are assumed and the tensile and pullout resistance of the nails crossing the failure surfaces are considered as the governing stabilizing forces.
Results and discussion
In this study, soil nails pattern effects on the performance and the stability of the soil nail wall are investigated. In Figure 2 variation of safety factors caused by different soil nails arrangements is illustrated. Generally three separated trends are observed in each curve. It demonstrates that at lower values of  with small bond length, the factor of safety is constant. As  increases the bond length behind the slip surface becomes longer and the safety factor is increases gradually. Eventually it reaches a point that the nails are long enough that increasing the nails length is not influential in the stability of the wall. Hence, nails at different elevations of a slope have different contribution to the overall stability of soil&#8211;nailed slopes.
Wall deformations need to be controlled by the allowable deformation level in designing the soil nailed wall especially when buildings or other underground facilities exist near the excavation. One of the most important parameters on soil nailed wall deformations is the arrangement of nail lengths.
Figure 3 shows the effect of nail arrangements on the wall horizontal deflection. In general, as and L increase, horizontal deflection of the wall decreases. The rate of this reduction is higher in lower base length. As it is
&#160;


illustrated in Figure 3, by increasing the length of the nails, the deflection is decreased till no significant reduction is observed.
As it is shown the arrangement and the layout of the nails are influential on the stability and deformation of the soil nailed walls. However, it is important to identify an optimal layout in a way that with optimum nail length, allowable stability is reached and the wall deformation stay in an allowable range.
Nail density is defined as the ratio of the required nail length per the unit area of the wall surface and defined as below:

where Li is nail length of each row and A is the stabilization area. Hence, estimating the nail density can be beneficial for the engineers to have a preliminary estimation of the costs of the project at beginning of the project.
Figure 4 indicates that the nail density governs the wall deformation. As it is seen, for different layouts with the same nail density, the resulted deflections are so close. Hence, it can be concluded that nail density is a key factor in determination of the wall deflection. It is also illustrated that, as the nail density increases, the reduction rate of the deflection is decreased. Effective nail density is defined as a threshold point that increasing the nail density is no longer effective on deformations.


As it is demonstrated in Figure 5, different layouts with a similar nail density have close values of safety factors. In walls with higher nail density increasing the nail length is fruitless and at lower nail density nails are not effective. So Optimum designation should be somewhere at the middle part with an allowable factor of safety. In the middle part the variation of factors of safety is more tangible.
Horizontal deflection profile
During the construction process the wall tends to move outward. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of soil nails arrangements on the deformation of a 10 m deep wall for a constant base length. As it is shown, by increasing  the horizontal deflection at the top of the wall decreases in a way that at higher  values, the wall deformation mode changes from overturning mode to bulging mode. 
Conclusion
In this paper the effects of soil nail arrangement on the stability and performance of the wall was investigated. An ordered arrangement of the nails was introduced and the effect of various nail lengths at different elevations of the wall was discussed. Major findings concluded from this research are summarized as follows:


Nail density was defined as a key parameter and the findings demonstrate that nail density plays an important role in controlling the stability and the performance of the soil nail walls, in a way that patterns with the same nail densities but different arrangements, result in the almost similar factors of safety and deformations. Therefore based on the allowable factor of safety and deformation, nail density can be concluded and the nail arrangement which meets the standards, is selected.
Threshold nail density is defined as a value of nail density which no significant reduction of deflection happens afterward.
Uniform distribution of the nails and lower values of  generates the maximum deflection at the top of the wall. As  increases, the bond length in the upper parts of the wall controls the deformation. In that case, the deflection value is bounded and the maximum deflection occurs at the middle depth of the wall. Therefore the mode of deformation changes from overturning mode to bulging mode. As a result, in the projects which their adjacent structures are of high importance, it is recommended to use more&#160;

&#160;Introduction
Soil has always been a major material in civil projects. Due to progress in science, different studies on the behavior of soil and its engineering characteristics have been conducted. As mentioned, there are different types of soil in nature; a small change in their structure and fabric under different environmental conditions or loading causes high deformation and settlements, which result in a reduction of strength and bonding between soil particles. Also, in this regard, some soft soils exist that are mostly composed of clay particles, with small shear strength and big settlement under low stress. With respect to the above-mentioned characteristics, these soils are referred to as problematic soils. The problematic soils consist of a silicate combination, whose major parts are clay minerals formed under weathering of rocks. Additionally, the precipitation of some soils and ground activity near the surface causes them to become problematic (Beckwith and Hansen [1]). Principally, in engineering, those soils on which construction is not safe, and which are affected by different environmental conditions, are defined as problematic soils. Collapsible soils are some of the most important of these problematic soils. The collapsibility phenomenon is defined as a sudden collapse of soil caused by the loss of the shear strength of soils. The collapsible potential depends on the initial void ration of soils. A few silty strata that are exposed to arid weather are susceptible to considerable volume decrease or collapse under soil saturation. Therefore, it is possible that surface water penetration in an irrigation form, pipe leakage and rise in ground water level may lead to great settlement.
In the last decade, the use of nanotechnology based on the science of production and nano-scale particles usage has become prevalent in many sciences. It can be said that nanoparticle application has made considerable progress, apart from nanotechnology, in recent years and has been one of its main aspects of this study. In this regard, the variety of nanoparticle depends on different applications.
The use of nano-materials has drawn the attention of various researchers in geotechnical engineering. One of the important nano-materials is nanoclay which, with respect to its characteristics, has had a wide range of applications in soil improvement techniques. Taha and Taha [2] and Majid et al. [3] have studied the effects of nano-materials, such as nanoluminum, nanocopper and nanoclay, on the swelling and shrinkage behavior in fine grain-size soils. Also, the compressive strength and permeability of soils increase and decrease with the addition of nanoclay, respectively, and are subjected to change of elastic to plastic behavior (Burton et al. 2009 [4], Gallagher and Lin [5], Persoff et al. [6]).
In this research, the main objective is to investigate the addition of nanoclay on the behavior of fine grain-size soil with experimental studies and to evaluate the different parameters on the soils&#8217; modification mechanisms.
Material and methods
Given the importance of this subject and the practical use of the results of this research in the improvement of problematic soils, as well as the field assessment conducted, it was observed that, in many parts of the main irrigation channels of Gonbad dam in northeastern Iran, which is an arid and semi-arid region of Iran, due to the specific geotechnical conditions and loess soils, large and non-uniform subsidence of soil has occurred around dewatering channels. This has caused large cracks to occur in the concrete channel coverage and subsoil and the surrounding wall soil, which ultimately will lead to the destruction of large parts of the channel mentioned above. Remarkably, given the nature of loess soils in the study area, dangers such as collapsibility, dispersivity, landslides, sinkholes and subsidence can be noted. In order to evaluate the effect of soil improvement with the help of nanoclay in field conditions, all the tests and geotechnical studies on soil samples located in the channels were performed under valid standards. In this regard, a number of exploratory boreholes were bored in the walls and floors of the considered channel. During this procedure, sampling was carried out in different depths of layers of soil in order for laboratory tests to be carried out and for identification of the soil. The undisturbed samples were also taken by a Shelby Tube Sampler for necessary tests. In order to determine the initial physical and mechanical properties of the used soils, various tests such as particle size analysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity and standard compaction were conducted. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the used soils.

The nano-materials used in this study have comprised nanoclay prepared by Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd with the brand clay montmorillonite K(10).
Results and discussion
By adding nanoclay to the soil, it is observed that the liquid limit and plasticity limit of samples gradually increases as can be seen in Figure 1.


Figure 1. Effect of nanoclay addition on the Atterberg limits test of soil samples
Based on the obtained results by adding different amounts of nanoclay to the soil, the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content decreased and increased, respectively. By adding nanoclay to the soil, strain increases at the moment of failure due to increased plasticity and changes in soil structure. It is worthy to note that the unconfined compressive strength in samples stabilized with nanoclay has been increased in comparison with the plain soil.&#160; Plain and improved soil samples were tested with different amounts of nanoclay under unconsolidated undrained conditions at different confining pressures.
To study the impact of nanoclay on the collapsibility potential of the soil, double consolidation tests were conducted to determine the deformation of plain and stabilized samples with various amounts of nanoclay under different vertical pressures. The test results showed that adding nanoclay has reduced the collapsibility potential of samples.
Conclusions
Due to existence of large areas of collapsible soils in Iran, improvement of these soils is necessary in civil projects. With considering the advances of nanotechnology sciences, in this research aiming to understand the impacts of different amounts of nanoclay on above mentioned soils have been studied. The soil samples used in experiments were collected from Golestan province including Boston dam of Gonbad and Incheboron near Gorgan city. In order to assessment of geotechnical behavior of soils, samples were mixed with varying percentages of nanoclay and different tests such as Atterberg limits, standard compaction, unconfined compressive strength, unconsolidated undrained triaxial and double consolidation were conducted. The results showed that nanoclay particles have a significant effect on the plasticity and strength behavior of used soils. Also, it was found that collapsibility index of soils decrease with adding nanoclay and it depends on the type of soil.&#160;

Introduction
Preparation of uniform and repeatable reconstituted sand specimens of required density is a prerequisite for obtaining reliable results from experimental studies. Among different methods of reconstituted specimens, sand pluviation technique is widely adopted by researchers because of its unique advantage. In this study, a new curtain traveling rainer (CTR) is developed for large model sand bed preparation in experimental studies. CTR is a simple and low-cost system which is worked on the principle of air pluviation of sand. It provides specimens with wide range of relative density of sand bed (viz, 30%-90%) and very high degree of spatial uniformity of density distribution while reducing the time of preparation the specimens. A series of laboratory tests is carried out in order to study the performance of the proposed system and the effect of the curtain speed, curtain width, height of the fall and flow rate on the relative density and uniformity of sand specimens. For the sand used in the present study, it was observed that the relative density increases with an increase in the curtain speed and height of the fall. Furthermore, increasing the curtain width results in reducing the relative density.
Material and Methods
The calibration of geotechnical in situ tests in granular soil requires the preparation of large, uniform, and replicable specimens of a desired density. When preparing calibration chamber specimens, the adoption of techniques such as chemical impregnation and the freezing method in order to obtain undisturbed granular specimens becomes unfeasible due to the technical limitations and relatively high expense of these techniques. Conversely, the pluviation method has been widely used because of its ability to simulate the depositional mechanism of the soil and because of its applicability to a wide range of specimens, from small specimens for triaxial tests to large specimens for calibration chamber tests.&#160;
soil sample was chosen from natural white-yellow silica sand mines of Firouzkooh, which can be categorized as poorly graded sand (SP) based on unified classification system (USCS). In order to control sand flow rate at the end of the pluviation path, a series of plates is designed to have rectangular openings with a width range of 2 to 4.5 mm. It should be noted that a sand reservoir is included in the transformer, which enables a uniform sand flow over the rectangular opening. the raining height is set at 100 mm to 500 mm with 100 mm steps. For more accuracy an extra test with&#160; height fall equal 150 mm is performed.
A contiguous system of wheel-rail is operated for effective transmission of the traveling funnel over the entire sample surface in the circular container. The device&#8217;s jacking system and its related components are the cause of several limitations, which lead to the implementation of two-joint methods for keeping the sand rain height constant during the pluviation and sample preparation process.
Results and discussion
The CTR system comprises sand transfer compartments from the main hopper to the sample container and a rectangular opening at the bottom of the hopper, which controls the pluviation flow rate. The main concept driver of this research is to reproduce large samples in the most efficient time.&#160; In order to recognize the uniformity of the reconstituted specimen in the vertical and horizontal directions, the variation of density is evaluated by placing 20 cylindrical molds within the specimen.
In this paper the effect of deposition intensity and the effect of height and flow rate on the sample relative density are evaluated.
Calibration of the sample preparatory device is very important in order to produce optional and repeatable samples with a specified relative density, in experimental studies and laboratory models. According to the test results, the effects of drop height and flow rate are investigated. Calibration graphs are presented in Figs. 1 and Fig. 2 for the proposed system in the case of 2.5 cm and 5 cm layer thickness.



Conclusion
This paper aims to extend the existing apparatus to achieve consistent low and high relative density sand samples. The preparation of low relative density samples is particularly important in liquefaction studies in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The comprehensive design and calibration of the CTR system can be concluded in the following points. The proposed method can easily be deployed to produce any arbitrary sample with a wide range of relative densities. Increasing the flow rate given a constant drop height leads to decrease in the relative density and is independent of layer thickness. Keeping constant the drop height and flow rate, higher relative densities can be achieved by increasing the curtain traveling velocity. There is a direct relationship between drop height and relative density. The&#160; results&#160; give&#160; some&#160; information&#160; about&#160; the&#160; deposition&#160; process&#160; and&#160; in particular about the terminal falling height. It can be henceforth stated that the performance of the proposed system is reliable and very acceptable due to high uniformity across the entire sample.&#160;

Introduction 
Bentonite has been used industrially in various construction projects. This material is used, due to its limited hydraulic conductivity, in some cases such as landfill, sealing walls and nuclear waste disposal tanks. Recently, many researchers have investigated the use of bentonite slurry systems for injection into granular soils under static and dynamic loading conditions in order to improve soil engineering performance. In this condition, bentonite slurry is deposited in a loose soil with low pressure and without disturbance in the structure of the soil under injection. Due to the nature of the thixotropy of the bentonite slurry, the injected material is deposited in the form of gel structures in the soil and leads to increasing soil resistance to static and dynamic loads. For suitable soil engineering properties in granular soil, the use of concentrated bentonite slurry is appropriate; high concentrations will limit the penetration of bentonite due to low soil permeability. In order to overcome this limitation, slurry rheological properties such as viscosity must be corrected in order to increase the depth of sand penetration. Other researchers observed that with the reduction of viscosity in the cement slurry with micro-size particles, the amount of its penetration in the sand column significantly increased.
In present paper, due to the lack of studies on the penetration rate of bentonite in sand and also the effective role of bentonite in the mechanical properties of sandy soils, the permeability of sandy soils by bentonite under the influence of change factors such as concentration of bentonite in injection suspension were investigated.
Material and Methods
In the present study, Firoozkooh sand samples with the traditional names of 131, D11 and D1 were used for testing. Different concentrations of bentonite slurry which is used in this study are 3, 5 and 7% of the bentonite to water ratio.
Figure 1 shows the location of the reading of the penetration length and Figure 2 shows variations in the length of infiltration against time for different heights of the pressure head.


Figure 1. The reading point of the penetration length in the sample


Figure 3 shows the variations of penetration length versus pressure heads for samples with a relative density of 70% at concentrations of bentonite slurry of 3, 5 and 7% in different aggregates. It can be stated that while the concentration of bentonite to water increases, the longitudinal penetration of the injected substance into the sample is reduced. For example, in sand 131 with Dr=70% the penetration value at a pressure head of 130 cm for suspension containing 3% bentonite slurry is 100 cm. The same values for samples containing 5% and 7% bentonite are 45 and 20 cm respectively. This is due to the increase in the presence of bentonite slurry (solid substance) in the suspension. The greater amount of solids inside the suspension causes the greater contact between sand grains with solid particles of suspensions. As a result, it causes increasing friction for longitudinal motion. Therefore, with increasing the concentration of suspension the length of its movement in the soil is reduced. Also, due to the increased viscosity of the injectable substance with increasing the amount of bentonite, the forward movement of the suspension under constant pressure is reduced. This is another important parameter that leads to a reduction in the length of the injection by increasing the concentration of the bentonite slurry.
&#160;It is also observed that the variation of penetration in higher concentrations is less than the low concentration. For example, in sand D1 (coarse sand) at a pressure height of 100 cm, the penetration rate at a concentration of 5% increases by 35% compared to a concentration of 3% and at a concentration of 7% increases by 300% compared to the sample containing 3% bentonite. This indicates that at less than 5% concentration the presence of bentonite in the sample is less effective, and the suspension can be more easily move between the pores. This result indicates that by reducing the pores inside the sand, the effect of changing to the suspension concentration is reduced.&#160;
