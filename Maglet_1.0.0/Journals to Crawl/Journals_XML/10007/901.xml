Given the dramatic and undeniable impact of ICT in various fields, particularly in fields of rural-agricultural Services and management tasks, necessary to apply this technology in the rural-agricultural Services has become critical and binding. Since, all the periods, in our country, the quantity and quality of servicing to rural settlements, has not been desirable due to various reasons, measures in order to servicing to rural settlements, seems very essential. This study, has been done with the inductive approach, in order to provide a general model for the use of ICT in Rural-Agricultural Services. This Model, provide this option that mechanisms and patterns of use of ICT in rural-agricultural Services, Be explanation based on considerations of general principles of their field. Too, eliminate the many gaps and weaknesses of the current model of rural servicing. Among the key features that distinguishes our model from other servicing models, can mentioned fairer access to services, taking advantage of the space rather than single-level hierarchical decreased mobility in currents displacements physical cost and space- oriented approach , network interact and links  and the benefits of &quot;virtual time&quot; in the enjoyment of the services.

Urban planning goal is improve the quality of life and is making &quot;good city to live”. Achieving this goal is possible by understanding the operative factors. Urban planning with neighborhood oriented planning and use of different experts, can provide context for creating residential environment. So in this paper, first, factors of neighborhood livability is detected and. then the livability of two neighborhoods of Tehran is compared. By reviewing the different studies around the world, operative factors and criteria was extracted and base on that, a questionnaire was prepared and field survey were done to fill the questionnaire sheets by peoples in Majidieh and SaadatAbad. Extracted dada from questionnaire sheets were compared by paired comparison and were weighted with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. The study shows that Environmental quality is the foremost factore for improving the neighborhood livability. Then access to local facilities especially leisure public spaces and social security have the greatest impact on the livability in neighborhoods. The main research hypothesis test shows SaadatAbad is more livable than Southern Majidieh, because of the environmental quality and reasonable access to local facilities.

Due to a rich cultural history, holding of ceremonies and customs have a special position in Iran. Upon passing of time, the people are insisting on performing their ceremonies including males, females, old men, old women and even adolescences. They make ready their living place for holding of ceremonies which are created through a long-term history. Upon starting the time of ceremonies throughout the city and/or different cities, we are witnessing of great changes in the civil environment not only for changing in cities skeleton but also fundamental changes in the mood of residents. It is in a way prior to start up of these ceremonies, we may witness a movement and changing the whole cities with a fresh soul as well. There are some major and minor elements sometimes in fixed and/or semi-fixed and moving of cities which make the cities ready for concerned ceremonies. This paper intends to recognize any effects of different ceremonies on the skeleton of cities. Then the goals of research are presented as follows: How the ceremonies are effective on cities’ skeleton? How the ceremonies are effective on the mood of cities? Firstly in this research we could analyzed relevant discussions about the mode and life of city and then divided them into three groups of elements (fixed, semi-fixed and moving) by the help of field researches and interpretation method. Then it was possible to specify any effects of which on relevant elements. Regarding all mentioned items, the most important consequences of ceremonies in society are: Citizenship feeling, belonging feeling to a place, belonging feeling to social cultural and religious groups, changing of non-active citizens into active ones and upgrading the meaning of citizenship. It may cause also closer connections of a person with civil environment and close contact between environment and citizens. These are important issues as much attractive as possible for urban planning scientists. As it is obvious, both theoretical and practical viewpoints are considered as the important priorities of discussions for upgrading the interactions of citizens with civil environment. Finally we may state that increasing any contacts with citizens and environment is the most important effects of ceremonies on cities’ skeleton. In case the citizens consider themselves as an integrated part of the environment, they will feel more responsibilities against it. Therefore they are not so much indifferent against the environment and they will be changed into social supporters and environment watches.

Setting the development and deprivation degree of statistical regions, neighborhoods, districts and blocks (Neighborhood Planning Units (NPU)) in city scale is one of the basic and main stages of organizing and empowering studies of the informal settlements. They have been designed with the aim of identifying the urban downstream neighborhoods, determining and selecting the “prioritized neighborhoods” in order to conduct the 3rd, 4th and 5th stages studies. Recent studies indicate that using of only one or two models with the mixed indexes has not been successful and achieving the desired result depends on using different statistical and mathematical models sorted based on various indexes. Then the achieved results of various models were combined to each other through considering strategies for achieving strong and reliable results on identification and suggestion of the target neighborhoods. In this study, a number of 65 statistical areas of Gonbad-e Kavus city were analyzed based on four types of indexes including anatomical, demographic economic and social (totally 33 indexes) using various statistical and mathematical models (e.g. the relative frequency, regression, AHP, taxonomy, human development index of the United Nations and opinions of experts). Finally, the target neighborhoods were determined through combining the results of the models and setting the related strategies. Therefore, the offered process and model in this study can be a basis for other researchers and managers who are involved with the planning and organizing the informal settlements.

	<abstract language="eng">
As globalization expanded in recent years, a great number of cities especially in developing countries have concentrated on effective efforts in order to be taken into consideration as global cities. Among these cities, the absence of Tehran, as one of the largest cities of Asia is tangible. Although Tehran has great potential of taking the advantage of these capitals, on the grounds that it is located in the Heartland Area , GAWC  world-city status classified Tehran among the cities that are neither global nor shared their national territory with a world city. Therefore, continuing denial of employing these capitals can end up with the deprivation from enormous advantages following these flows. In this regard, this study is carried out to propose some strategies to promote Tehran as a global city based on identifying key factors which can lead to its globalization.

There is time that scientific societies allocate great deal of effort in improvement of their educational system in an effort to meet challenges of today’s cities. Part of this effort involves quality publications as articles and books. Therefore this article explains the main subjects of urban planning&amp; design documents and highlights the shortcomings and deficiencies of the process.Present article is based on quantitative approach. Considered statistical society contains 954 published articles of 13 journals from 2008 -2011. The results show that urban planning &amp; design (urbanism) is more interesting than the other scientific basis -architecture, geography and art- for researchers. Also over three past years, urban planning and regional planning were more showbiz than urban management and urban design issues. It is noteworthy that the debate over land use issueswas one of the hottest debates in the past three years.

	<abstract language="eng">Although, cities and urbanization, has a history as long as human life, no city has ever been permanent in the history, unless it have had a specific cultural identity. Islam is the highlight of the cultural overlay, and from the beginning of its influence, it based the Islamic identity on social factors especially in urban components. In the first study using a library–documentation method, the theoretical framework of the study was obtained including the eight important indexes of Islamic cities. With considering the Islamic identity, the indexes were investigated from a religious point of view. In the next step, using the field method and a survey of scholars in the field, the weight of every index was determined. Using the simple weighting method of SAW a systematic method was developed to assess the cities based on the presented Islamic indexes. The results of the survey indicated that none of the indexes was insignificant in the view of the architects and the Quran Sciences scholars, rather architects paid more attention to the urban appearance, and the Quran Sciences scholars focused more on the spirituality prevailing in the city. </abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Rapid growth of urbanization in the early 20th century faced cities with numerous problems, So that solving these problems were addressed in the context of urban development plans and so the comprehensive plans were appeared by emphasis on the physical aspects . Following disclosing the defects of such plans, systematic plans and finally strategic plans emerged. This plans given to the urbanism’s problems were a step toward improving  status quo (existing position) along with Strategic projects, sustainable development issues, particularly sustainable urban development was introduced, a development that will be considered all economic, social and environmental problems. Strategic plans and sustainable development approaches are complementary. Because the reason for being successful is in enduring of their plans and implementation of sustainable approach is in strategic plans. One of the main steps in strategic plans is strategy formulation that it is clear that using SWOT technique in these plans can not lead to formulation exact strategy solitude. With regard to the literature, it is appear that we can reduce the problems of SWOT technique by fuzzy logic. And also, other studies show that Rey city as a historical city is being far away from sustainable development indexes. It seems to be necessary to formulation strategic plans to exit this situation.in this paper, we formulation development strategic for zone 1 of this city and we achieved to 6 strategies that blocking local access to prevent from local traffic and air pollutants, establishing an integrated regulatory in defenseless sites (cemeteries and moorland) and  creating active applications in it, and preventing from the spread of industrial  and workshops activities to raise coherence in index are some of the most important strategies.</abstract>

Due to these changes, identification and evaluation of recycling potential takes into account a great import ancient order to protect rural safety, health and environment. Therefore, this paper explores the concept of waste management system and the quality and quantity of waste generated in Bushehr province's villages based on field studies and questionnaire distribution.94 percent of villages are facing the problem of not participating in the source separation, collection and disposal of waste and 62.5percent of villages are faced with the problem of getting rid of waste by rural people.In41% of cases, the rural, if they do not see the results, they are not willing to cooperate in the process of biogas production. Using the Wilcoxon testwith95% confidence intervals, hypothesis that most of the executive managements of waste in rural areas of this province are at the least organized level, is confirmed. Three elements of functional elements (transportation, recycling and disposal) in order to reduce total costs and increase the efficiency of the system should be jointly implemented regionally.
