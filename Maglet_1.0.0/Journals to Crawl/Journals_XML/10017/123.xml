				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[By virtue of intelligence, creativity, and scientific ability, the elites are great potentials and their use in the military service is important and attracting them from the existing competitive labor market is vital. Accurate knowledge of effective external and internal factors of AJA is necessary to manage the elites who employed recently. The present study is an applied research using a descriptive-analytic method and expert procedures. The data collection method was a library and field one. The researcher-made questionnaire distributed to 130 members of the population and finally 117 questionnaire filled by them. To determine the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha method was used and descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data using the internal factor evaluation matrix, external factors evaluation matrix and the brainstorming. In the results, the dimensions and components of the recognition of external and internal factors of AJA were considered. The following components were identified in the internal dimension: Staff finding, selection, education, research, technology, deployment, service compensation, organizational culture and atmosphere, financial resources and regulations. The external environmental dimensions were classified into distant and close environments. The remote environment analysis carried out using PESTEL method and near environment analysis using three components of education, research and military. The key external and internal factors were determined and 10 strength points, 6 weakness points, 5 opportunities and 4 threats were identified. Using position assessment matrix and strategic operations, it was suggested that AJA is in a challenging position and need to exploit external opportunities using internal strengths.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Military organizations are continually looking for effective commanders, managers and leaders who enjoy with high humanistic values; in the era of cultural and media invasion, the thoughts of managers, commanders and leaders are attacked by enemies who try to replace the supreme thoughts with false and materialistic thoughts, and using covert and overt attacks, they seek to create a barrier in manifestation of true sciences and proper understanding of ideas. Based on these arguments, it is the necessity to explain the fundamental theories and great ideas that result in the earthen and spiritual success of human. Therefore, the ideology and proper understanding of military commanding, leadership and management of the Supreme Leader may be considered as one of the basic priorities in commanding armed forces. The present study aimed to design a model to describe appropriate commanding in the Supreme Leader perspective which was implemented qualitatively using Grounded Theory in three stages of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The qualitative results of the current study showed that the worthwhile attributes of commanding leads to a sense of patriotism and reinforcement of defense sense leading to the obedience sense and trustworthiness using cooperation of ground forces and organizational interventions. The result of such a formation in AJA organization contribute to strengthening religious beliefs and values, personal self-esteem and self-sufficiency, moving towards goals and missions, to rely on individual capabilities, adaptability and flexibility in hardship situations.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Today, public policy evaluation is inevitable for governments due to the more complex community governance. Policy evaluation helps to adopt the most effective policies with the lowest costs through more conscious policy-making using appropriate evidences. An important challenge facing the general policy system in Iran is how to evaluate the quality of general policies and programs. Accordingly, reviewing the related literature and the opinions of experts in the field of general policy, factors influencing the evaluation of the quality of public policy identified. The results obtained from the conceptual model of research using Amos software and structural equation modeling showed that based on the public policy process, the most effective stages in the quality of general policy are the stages of design and legitimization of public policy with an effect coefficient of 0.68 and 0.57, respectively]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The military logistical units are military organizations that must operate in a more complex environment than before. Therefore, they need to improve their speed and flexibility like other organizations. The importance of sustainable and flexible logistics is vital for the success of all military forces. Detection logistics and the response to achieve these goals include actions such as: Enhancing self-adaptation through local coordination with the help of IT systems, encouraging better interaction, and re-combination in low-levels. The main aim of the current study is investigating the effect of electronic logistics in developing the logistics of detection and response in a military context (a military organization). This study used an applied orientation and a descriptive-analytic purpose, in which the main factors and components of the variables were identified by the library method to present the conceptual model of the research. Then, SEM structural equation modeling and Smart PLS software was used to measure the proposed model, in addition, the VAF index used to measure the type and extent of intermediate effect of the research variables. The population of the current study included 130 experts and users of electronic logistics in a military organization that 98 of them included in the sample using Cochran formula. The results of the research indicated the importance and positive impact of diagnosis and response approach on military logistics with the effect of a minor intervention of electronic logistics.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This is an applied research as its results are applicable and also it assists a descriptive method with a population including 30 university instructors, curriculum developers, aeronautical training managers and experts selected by a non-probable, available, and purposive sampling method. The data gathered by forming three focal groups and analyzed in the framework of organic model. The results showed that the process of implementation of ASP faced some damages in four dimensions including the causes of development, the mechanism of the effect, the changes made and the functional implications, in all four stages (needs analysis, design and development, implementation and evaluation) that require the adoption of proposed corrective solutions to get out of potential damages]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[In the new era of civil battles, the use of high-reliability equipment and weapons, taking into account variables such as cost, volume and total weight, are among main factors that can lead to success. The current study attempts to present a mathematical model to optimize designing military equipment and weapons that increases the reliability and decreases the costs and considers some limitations such as volume and total weight. One of the new approaches to improve the reliability of systems is the use of surplus components (redundancy allocation); but the past studies which aimed to simplifying and making possible the mathematical calculations, impose some assumptions to the model such as impossibility of repairing components, fixed and simple defective rate (such as exponential distribution function), or mono-purpose. However, the present study both remove the mentioned assumptions due to the possibility of repairing various parts of the military equipment, the defective rate and repair of different components, as well as the existence of various purposes, attempts to design a functional model compatible with the operating environment. The current study is a developmental research in the purpose, and an experimental research in method. In addition, according to the research assumptions and as the redundancy allocation is located in hard problem category (NP-hard), a multi-objective optimization technique (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) is used and also the simulation technique is used to investigate the defection and repair rate. At the end of the study, the model and solution is fully described using a military sample and authentic data.]]></dcterms:abstract>
