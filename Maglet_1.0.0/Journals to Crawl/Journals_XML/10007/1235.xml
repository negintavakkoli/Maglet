Before the invention of computer-aided design, most manufacturing processes were limited to one of two options: mass production or customization. Mass production is the production of large amounts of identical parts. The idea has existed for hundreds of years (the Venetian Arsenal, a shipyard in Venice, employed mass production to produce one ship per day as far back as the 14th or 15th century), but it did not achieve widespread popularity until its adoption by Henry Ford’s Ford Motor Company (Henry Ford’s famous quote: “Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants — so long as it is black.”). Due to economies of scale, mass production reduces costs significantly, but it prohibits individual choice. The industrialized method of building, which has been in use since World War II for the construction of residential areas, does not leave much room for individual choice. This lack of choice is common when first introducing mass production in car industry. However, other industries have shown that mass production can be combined with individual choice. 
This approach is called mass customization. It is a mix between the two systems that attempts to combine the low cost of mass production with the flexibility of custom work. Giving buyers more freedom of choice when it comes to the design of their new house will require their participation in the design process. This method is called Self-building that users can design their own buildings. Although not inherently required, mass customization is often achieved through computer aided design, which allows for more flexible output with little or no additional variable costs (though at the cost of a higher up-front investment). By making the production process more flexible, designs that are tailored to individuals can still be produced industrially. But this approach faced with a challenge in house industry because of lacking standardized design and technology that were exist in other industries.
In 21th century by introducing new technologies like CAD-CAM and robotic methods of construction, this gap was filled so mass customization could be justified economically in the house construction industry. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of participation of users in the design process, in order to move towards sustainable construction in the house industry in Iran. The subpopulation of this research was 50 families living in prefabricated house in Parand town in Tehran. The survey tool is a questionnaire which was set up in the 26 questions in multiple-choice format that evaluates social sustainability attributes in prefabricated houses. The result shows that these houses have serious weakness in social sustainability indicators in a way that users had no role in the design process and 75% of them are believed that it is better to go back to the traditional method of construction instead of new methods. Finding of this study indicate that with rapid population growth and demand for housing in the country, housing industry in Iran should move toward mass customization in order to achieve successful sustainable construction.

Has long been a municipality as a new approach in the field of urban management, and tracking is introduced. This management approach strives to provide common services to the citizens of the municipality based on modern information and communication technology-based mechanisms arising from the communication form. Transparency means that the performance of public functions, financial decisions and policies, public sector accounts, and pre financial projections, they are subject to public notice. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of commerce on the transparency function. The population of municipalities in the southern province of West Azerbaijan and questionnaires were used to collect data. In this study three types serve different aspects of commerce, including providing information offline, online services and mechanisms is the dividing line. The analysis of data Friedman test and the Wilcoxon test was used and the results indicate that all aspects of commerce have an impact on the transparency of municipal performance.

The life has a definition beyond every day activities. Postmodernism has recently provided a context to increase versatility in both cities and neighborhoods in order to improve not only the power of choice of citizens but also the quality of urban life. Studies indicates that although neighborhood, as a minimized scheme of a society, had functioned as an autonomous fabric in traditional urban planning of Iran due to its settlement, work, entertainment and transport functions appropriate to people’s needs, recent urban planning has declined neighborhoods to residential environments by differentiating urban functions and concentrating them in special centers.
Thus, this study is designed to investigate the role of functional diversity in residential satisfaction by comparing Narmak neighborhood (high functional diversity) and Tehranpars (low functional diversity). In order to achieve this goal, quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Data is collected by survey and documentary methods. In addition, stratified sampling is used as sampling method. Data were analyzed by Importance satisfaction rate and variation finding methods. The population for this study according to population of 1385 is 178308(Total Population NARMAK and Tehran Pars) and Sample size by using Cochran's formula(95%)is 383 persons. A two-stage cluster sampling is done. At first according to the area and population of NARMAK and Tehran Pars research area split into three clusters, include: Tehran Pars, NARMAK in Eastern and Western NARMAK. After that, according to the residents of these clusters and the aim the article(residential satisfaction measurement of neighborhoods) the clusters were separated into 10 sub-clusters. So that, Tehran Pars contains three clusters: Pleiades neighborhood, community and neighborhood Rashid Seminary Eastern NARMAK three clusters include: neighborhood Dardasht (Metro School), neighborhood Dardasht (October), Neighborhood Telephone and Western NARMAK four clusters including : Samangan, Neighborhood prophecy, Golestan district and neighborhood were segregated mandate. In the next step, based on quota sampling (classification), the number of samples required in each cluster are identified. Thus, the ratio of population to the total population of the study area was calculated for the first three clusters. Multiplying the ratio of the number 383 (the total number of samples), samples required in Tehran Pars (99), NARMAK East (136) and Western NARMAK (148), respectively.
The results of this study show that the improvement of residential satisfaction cannot be reached exclusively through emphasizing on residential indexes. The key to success is to increase the functional diversity of neighborhood by empowering other functions. Even though, the importance and preference of each one of these functions is different in diverse urban locations and fabrics. Prior to changing the concept of home, which has the greatest effect on people's residential satisfaction, it is required to reinforce work opportunities in Narmakand and transportation accessibility in Tehranpars. In addition, it seems that providing a responsive atmosphere to people’s requirements can be the only way to reach this goal.

Social problems are among the major issued of the distressed areas in Iran which can be mentioned as “social instability”. Moreover, less applied attention is paid to social layers and aspects in preparation of renovation plans for such areas. “Social sustainability” is one of the triple aspects of sustainable development which its theoretical framework can be applied in urban plans and programs along considering improvement of the social situation of urban fabrics. Applied use of this theoretical framework requires compilation of urban planning indicators and factors which would affect promotion of social sustainability. This paper which is a part of the process of a PhD dissertation is seeking to compile the location indicators and factors effective in promotion of social sustainability in urban distressed fabrics to compile the model gained from them. For this, a sectional survey on the rate of effectiveness of place indicators on promotion of Social sustainability gained from the previous step of this research was conducted among 91 experts having the experience of renovation in distresses areas and 176 persons residing in distressed fabrics of Takhti neighborhood in Tehran (as case study). Then, by help of path analysis method and SPSS software the evaluated indicators were categorized in a structure of factors and the model gained from the relations between these factors and their correlation coefficients was compiled by help of path analysis method and AMOS software. According to this, 20 place indicators effective in promotion of social sustainability in distressed fabrics on were categorized in 5 factors of “security”, “activity acceptance”, “identity acquiring”, “physical-spatial integration” and “people-oriented state” and the correlation coefficients between them were determined in the format of the achieved model.

Today one of the most important issues that could improve access for residents of cities and towns to provide services are utilities distribution. One of the most important services in addition to the proper distribution of reduction of urban problems (traffic, etc.) will also help to urban residents health are convenient access to medical care. Healthcare service should be distributed in such a way that the urban population in the shortest possible time have access to this services therefore suitable distribution of these service in urban areas is essential for convenient access to urban residents. In this study, using a Network Analyst to assess the spatial distribution of urban healthcare centers in the Zanjan city has been evaluated and then using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been attempting to allocation of new medical centers. The aim of this study was to identify of limitations accessibility to urban medical centers in Zanjan city and then offer suggestions for places to build new urban medical centers. The results showed that North West and North East parts of the city of Zanjan, mostly built in the past two decades, have less access to urban medical centers And about 76,242 people in the city of Zanjan has not convenient access to medical Centers.
