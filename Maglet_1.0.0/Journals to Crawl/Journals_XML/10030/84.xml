	<abstract language="eng">A part of Khaghani's Divan includes his Arabic poems where one can be find a large number of errors which have not already been studied and discussed. In this paper, attempts are made to illustrate some of these errors and correct them. In so doing, the present researchers have studied these errors stemming from misreading (Tashif), distorting and miswriting, and considering Khaghani's other poems and Arab poets, the syntagmatic (metonymic) level of poems, Khaghani's poetical style, figures of speech, copies, meanings, etc,&#160; we have suggested the correct forms. These errors are so frequent; hence, it is highly necessary to correct them. Due to Khaghani's great status, his artistic skills and his powerful rhetoric in Persian and Arabic languages, it is highly necessary to study these poems more closely and precisely again.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Saadi is undoubtedly the master of lyric poem in Persian literature. His Melodious and impressive speech in comparison with other poets' sonnets, is related to many cultural, linguistic, expressive, pictorial factors. Although many elegant points concerning his poems have already been investigated by Henri Masse, Gh.Yousefi, A.dashti, M.Ebadiyan, S.Hamidiyan, T. Poornamdariyan, Z.Movahhed etc., there are still many details about the unique techniques in his sonnets which await further research in order to understand the secret of his beautiful speech and extraordinary impulse. In this article, we have addressed ''addressing'' as a determining factor. The determinative appearance of this factor in Saadi's sonnets has a great role in motivational aspect of his poems. Following a quick introduction of addressing, we present the factors that amplify this sense in saadi's sonnets. He has made the addressing factors in his poems by utilizing artistic techniques and making a presence feeling. It is concluded that the most important effect of &#34;presence feeling&#34; and the &#34;addressing factor&#34; is the audience's excitation. Finally, the addressed factors of saadi's speech are analyzed and presented. In this research, we have used the document analysis method and in the last section we present the distribution of data and statistics of the addressed factors.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Najdi is one of the outstanding contemporary writers due to his specific style. He has a different attitude towards human life and cultural elements of Iran, which makes his stories a good subject for discussion and research. In this article, two stories of Najdi are analyzed in the light of Deconstruction: &#8220;The Day of Asb-rizi&#8221; and &#8220;The Night of Killing Sohrab&#8221;. Deconstruction is mostly based on Derrida&#8217;s theory. It originated and was initially used in Philosophy and then it spread to literary criticism. The aim of Deconstruction is to find the binary oppositions, to analyze them in order to reveal the contradictory points and to deny the accepted assumptions. The results of this process is to doubt those beliefs that have been considered as axiomatic up to that time. In Najdi&#8217;s stories, the binary oppositions include man/animal, man/nature and man and civilization. In &#8220;The Day of Asb-rizi&#8221;, the opposition between man and animal, and, freedom and slavery causes some contradictions in the major themes of the story. In &#8220;The Night of Killing Sohrab&#8221;, the binary opposition is that of harsh patriarchal world/ innocent childish world, or, experience/inexperience.</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">The ancient&#160; translations and interpretations of the&#160; Holy Qur'an are among the less recognized capitals of the great treasures of the Persian language, consisting of the various&#160; words of&#160; the different&#160; domains and&#160; periods of this language and&#160; can be a rich&#160; treasure house in order to develop the&#160; Persian language. Terjemah&#160; Tafsir&#160; Tabari is one of the oldest and richest translations and interpretations which has been provided on the basis&#160; of&#160; the book&#160; of&#160; Tafsir&#160; Tabari&#160; and is of particular importance both from the point of&#160; view of the Persian language history and in terms of&#160; the&#160; history of religious texts. However, the edition which is available has some problems considering the regulations of the correction technique and conditions of the Persian language dialectology. In this article, attempts are made to refer to some typical cases and the necessity for re-correction of this valuable book based on another copy is highlighted.&#160;</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Quranic tales have always been used by Persian poets in order to create beautiful and unique themes and images. One of these tales is the tale of Adam and Eve and their Fall from Heaven due to eating the Forbidden Fruit. Following most Islamic commentaries, wheat has been considered as this fruit in classic Persian poetry, but the reading of contemporary poets of this tale is different. Sometimes, their reading is similar to classic poets but in other times, following the Old Testament, they consider the apple or the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil as this fruit, and still in other times they have a mixed reading of Islamic and Jewish traditions. Also, some contemporary poets have proposed a symbolic reading of this tale. This article, initially provides a history of the tale of Forbidden Tree in the Quran, Old Testament and their commentaries. Then, this issue is investigated in the poems of twenty outstanding contemporary poets (from Nima to the present time) and their poems are compared with Quranic and Biblical narratives. The results show that those contemporary poets which have traditional views, have paid attention to Islamic narratives whereas modern poets have often used Biblical narratives</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">Dependency nominal phrases are among the main kinds of nominal phrases. These phrases have spread in kinds and types. In this paper, we investigate these kinds of phrases in the whole text of Tarikh-e-Bal&#225;mi from the historical grammar perspective. This work is indeed one of the first remained Dari Persian manuscripts. More specifically, we study issues that have historical aspects or are semantical and considered as stylistic features. The method adopted in this study is based on the definitions and divisions that late professor Farshidvard who wrote extensively on these nominal groups. Also, we use other grammar books, whenever they are relevant to our discussion. The main goal of this article is providing an accurate historical recognition of dependency nominal phrases that are subtle issues in syntax and are considered as frequently used syntactic groups in discourse. It is assumed that the scientific investigation of grammatical subjects in a specific text may enrich the historical grammar and also may shed lights on old texts.</abstract>
