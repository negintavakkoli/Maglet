It might be possible to consider this importance as the result of fundamental changes in intellectual patterns during the past two decades in one side and its proposal in all aspects of human life on the other side though this is one of the main influential concepts in urban landscape and vision, and there are various approaches available regarding this matter. These approaches have decreased the nature of landscape concept to simple decorating concept and even considering it equal to any type of interaction between human and environment and it identification. So there are several results for each definition in terms of planning and management. Urban landscape &amp;ndash as the objective of city &amp;ndash is the most impressive urban index for human beings. The issue of lack of attention to city vision and landscape, and efforts in identifying and creating of it, is one of the most important problems of cities. Increase in Population as a threat to city life, migration of rural population to urban areas and large cities, traffic, air pollution, open space, green space and playgrounds and several other issues, are among the items that have been discussed relatively more than issue of urban landscape and its problems and more papers and books have been written on it. Urban landscape is in fact all the elements that can be seen in the city and can be watched by human eyes. These items form urban landscape when they are integrated and combined with several factors in every moment. This article seeks to enhance the environmental quality to organize urban landscape in Sa&amp;rsquodi Street through discovery of historical meanings, cultural codes and local architectural terms in visual landscape of the city, and giving sense to it in physical and visual formats. Therefor with review of Store street in New York &amp;ndash as an foreign sample - and Hamze street in Isfahan &amp;ndash as a domestic sample &amp;ndash the existing situation of Sa&amp;rsquodi street is reviewed and SWOT analysis is then implemented for examining the weaknesses and strength factors and regulating the urban landscape of this street through field-documentary studies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
