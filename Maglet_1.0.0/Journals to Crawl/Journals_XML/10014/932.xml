	<Abstract>Oil and gas well drilling operations due to the nature and type of activities is dealing with various hazards. So protecting human resources and equipment is mandatory for all staff. This study aimed to identify the risks of drilling jobs using the &#8220;Job Hazard Analysis&#8221; (JHA) study and provide control measures to reduce the risk of these hazards. Statistical population of interest in this project is land rig drilling operations staff in North Drilling Company (NDCo).

The results showed that 71.7 percent of risk safety hazards are identified and then health hazards, ergonomic hazards and hazards associated with materials and equipment, respectively, 13.4, 9.3 and 5.6 percent were the risks identified. Also 84.4 and 36.5 % of low-risk and moderate-risk levels were identified, respectively and 15.1 per cent of the risk levels were high risk that they require immediate implementation of control measures to reduce the risk level of hazards</Abstract>

	<Abstract>Based on the macroeconomic policies of the country regarding eliminating reliance on the sale of crude oil and in order to further develop the petrochemical industry and considering the special features of this industry including its technology based nature, facing fast changes and strong competition in the region, it is necessary for the active petrochemical companies to make plans with more intelligence and speed and take their future steps more strongly and objectively. However, today it is believed in the management field, that the competencies of the organization&#8217;s top management can play an important role in the success of the companies.

In the next step, through conducting in-depth interviews with managing directors of the petrochemical companies which has been selected for 4 consequent years as superior companies, based on the&#160;&#160; &#8220;Excellence Award&#8221; process in petrochemical industry and the reports on Iranian superior companies, selected in imi-100, it was tried to identify the competencies required&#160; and Thematic Analysis technique has been used for initial analysis of these competencies
In order to examine the reliability of the interviews findings, the results were edited and distributed in the form of questionnaires among the university and petrochemical industry elites.
