	<abstract_fa>&lt;p&gt;This research aimed to identify the dimensions, components, priorities and distinction between existing and desired condition, organizational forgetting management and provides a model for appropriate mechanisms for controlling it at university. The research in term of goal is practical and giving quantitative data and method is descriptive-survey research. In order to validate the measurement, content validity has been used and to assess the reliability the Cronbach's Alpha has been applied. The study population consists of faculty and staff at Islamic Azad University in district eight. Considering the total size of faculty and staff at Islamic Azad University (13117), sample size is determined (375). According to the main question of this research, some theoretical studies and exploratory ones based on existing documents, questionnaires and interviews with experts were done. Questionnaires have been distributed and analyzed, then current and ideal situation were identified. Therefore, the statistical tables were prepared and described. To do so, inferential statistical methods have been used with SPSS and Lisrel so that the relationship between variables can be measured and the four management aspects of the research consisting of process, technology, culture and structure are determined to evaluate the organizational forgetting management. By comparing the conditions and dimensions in current and ideal state, a considerable gap was found between the two mentioned states. On the basis of the analyses, the strengths and weaknesses were found and the mechanisms to eliminate this gap were expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
