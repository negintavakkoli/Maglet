The target population for this study consists of support staff of Iranâ€™s national gas company. The instrument for gathering data was questionnaire. The results of research showed that psychological contract fulfillment (PCF) has a positive and significant effect on OC. The results also showed a significant, positive and relatively weak effect of PO on PCF and OC. Despite of this, PCF could not mediate the relationship between PO and OC.
