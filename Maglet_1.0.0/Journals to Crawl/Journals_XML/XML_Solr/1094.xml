This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the establishment of a work environment curriculum-model in related documents and to identify its economic consequences. For this purpose, the relevant documents have been examined from the beginning. The research population includes all published works in this field from 1993 to 2017 in eight valid databases. The content of the documents was to categorize and organize the effective factors on the deployment of the work environment curriculum using the MAXQDA18 software. Then Delphi technique was used to validate these factors. The most important factors identified are individual, background, and occupational ones.
