	<abstract language="eng">&#160;The aim of this research was to develop a retirement management model in the Workers' Refah Bank. In terms of its purpose, the method is a combination of the phenomenological method in the quantitative part and descriptive-correlation method, in the quantitative part of research. The statistical population of the research in the qualitative section has been 39 people including: close-to-retirement (15 people), during retirement (8 people) and retirees (16 people). Snowball method has been used until reaching saturation of information. The population of research in the quantitative section for close to retirement stage was 115, for retirement stage, 30 persons and for after retirement stage was 1175 people. The sample size was 92, 28 and 285, respectively, based on random sampling for each of these three groups. The data collection tool was semi-structured interview in the qualitative part and the questionnaire, in the quantitative part of research. Validity of the questionnaires was reviewed by using content validity-contextual validity as well as structural validity. The reliability of the questionnaires was calculated through Cronbach's alpha, which was calculated for all three questionnaires above 0.8 which indicates their good reliability. &#160;In order to analyze the data in the qualitative section, the 7-step quantitative method of Colaizzi was used and in the quantitative part, statistical tests such as factor analysis, mean and variance test, cross-sectional test and model quality test were used. Finally, dimensions and components of our model were identified and confirmed for close-to-retirement (concerns, expectations, and expectations) during retirement (concerns, needs and motives, expectations) and for after-retirement (challenges, expectations, personal strategies). &#160;</abstract>

	<abstract language="eng">The present research aimed to analyze instructional design,workplace learning, and selecting the optimum model of learning for human resources training in petrochemical industry.The previous roles have become faint and new opportunities have appeared in petrochemical industry by starting the process of privatization and changing the nature of the company from holding to a governance and development organization. So, the main questions in this study were: what is the similarity among the world popular models about instructional design and workplace learning models? What is the most adaptive model about training and workplace learning in petrochemical industry? Therefore, a qualitative meta-synthesis approach has been used to reply these questions. This process was conducted in two steps. Its first step was conducted by Sandelowski and Barroso method in 2007. The second step was conducted by analysis of documents, observation, and experts' views using Maxqda software. Finally, the related adaptive model to the characteristics of petrochemical industry was offered including five dimentions of: performance analysis, performance design, performance development, performance implementation, and performance monitoring which were adopted from 70:20:10, Mager and human performance technology models. Regarding the dominant systematic approach in instructional design and workplace learning model, and considering of performance conception in all designing processes, it seems that the present study,as the first study in this field, can have an effective role in organizational training.t

Because, employees’ attitudes can affect their behavior in the workplace. Therefore, it's important to understand what factors can affect it. In this regard, due to the increasing level of employees' maturity in many organizations and becoming knowledge-based, two factors of organizational trust and psychological contracts in this research have been considered and their relationship with employees’ attitudes has been studied. In this process, by analyzing the theoretical foundations and the relationship between the factors and components constituting each of the variables studied, the conceptual model of the research has been extracted and tested in one of the companies of the National Iranian Oil Company. The research method used in this research has been descriptive correlational. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between the three variables of organizational trust, psychological contracts and occupational attitudes with each other. Also, the mediating role of psychological contract in the relationship between organizational trust and job attitudes was also confirmed</abstract>
