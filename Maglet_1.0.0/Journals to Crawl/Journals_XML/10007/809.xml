			<CONTENT>The vast expanse of the urban distressed areas in the country and multiple damages that their inhabitants face on economic, social and cultural aspects remind the need for higher attention to these constructions. Meanwhile, Tehran's distressed areas with more than 3268 hectares (5.3% of the area of ​​Tehran) has a population of one million and three hundred thousand people in it, is one of the priorities of the improvement and renovations in the country. According to what most experts and researchers say one of the main obstacles to the process of improvement and renovation of the urban distressed areas, is the selection and use of appropriate methods of financing. Several methods of financing that have been raised to be used in the process of improvement and renovation,&amp;nbsp;on one hand due to the variety they provide are an opportunity, and on the other hand face the managers and city decision-makers with some problems in the process of selection and utilization, because using any of the methods depends on several regional and local factors. In this regard and in order to facilitate the process of decision-making in the process of improvement and renovation of urban distressed areas, this research used a cross-sectional study and also investigated the evaluation criteria and different methods of financing the distressed areas and &amp;nbsp;using the obtained field data from questionnaires distributed in two stages using ANOVA test, tested the research hypothesis in order to determine the best financing method according to the improvement and renovation process from the perspective of the tested criteria and in this way tried to compare the various methods of financing in order to take advantage of the process of improving and renovation of urban distressed areas in Tehran. In this regard and based on the obtained results three methods of repayment from the operation of the project, civic engagement (contract) -guaranteed and selling shares were identified as ways with the highest priority to utilize in the process of improvement and renovation of the urban distressed areas of Tehran.

			<CONTENT>University students are exposed to stress because of their age and their particular situation. Stress can cause serious problems to the health and academic performance of students. One of the factors affecting stress is the environment. Therefore, finding ways to reduce stress in universities is important and needs to be investigated. Unfortunately, one of the fundamental problems of universities is the lack of features and qualities of a space that reduces the stress of students. This means that university spaces are not designed and constructed for reducing the stress of students and enough attention was not paid to this issue. The relative lack of research in this field makes necessary to pay attention to this issue and carry out studies in this regard. The purpose of this study is to provide effective spatial features to reduce the stress of university students and to determine the effectiveness of each of these features. The research is conducted by survey method and Delphi technique was carried out in three rounds. For this purpose, firstly open-ended questionnaires were distributed among the experts. Then the answers were investigated and the lists of features were extracted. In the next step, based on the information obtained, close-ended questionnaires were made and the importance levels of features were put into question among the experts and then data were analyzed using SPSS software. In the final stage, experts expressed their final opinions considering the statistical results of the previous stage. The results of this study showed that effective spatial features on stress reduction of students are classified by influencing level into four categories of environmental conditions, natural factors, environmental comfort and physical aspects. And among the details of these features, adequate and proper light for spaces&amp;rdquo;, connecting with outdoor and semi-outdoor spaces and desirable sound in spaces, are of utmost importance.

			<CONTENT>Investigation on modern history of urban planning in Iran shows that there are three approaches in the subject under discussion: &amp;ldquo;Modernism and Westernism&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Traditionalism and anti-Westernism&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Adopt and Adapt&amp;rdquo;. Proponents of the first approach believe in encouraging methods to use the external concepts. The second, is the idea about ​​cultural and religious values, ​​thereby everything with nontraditional orientation is rejected. In the third approach the thinkers believe that if the parts of tradition are synthesized by modernity, culture and religion can adapt themselves with the development. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adaptation of traditional urban design patterns of Islamic-Iranian cities in incompatible district of new Iranian cities (spontaneous settlements) and to focus on the application of the third approach in the current situation of Iranian cities. On this basis, the method of comparative analysis has been applied to survey the differences and similarities between historical districts and spontaneous settlements. Studies show that there are rather similarities among physical - spatial parameters (such as structural and environmental criteria) between the two types of districts; because both of these residential districts formed as organic structures that are unstable against unexpected risks and earthquake. However, there are the differences between these two types of districts in organized and formed periods. Despite historical districts that have been consolidated and organized during hundreds of years, spontaneous urban textures formed quickly and without any plan and planning. Meanwhile, the historical districts have usually integrated townscapes and unique materials such as clay, bricks or stone, while this character (integrated townscape and unique materials) never have been seen in the spontaneous settlements. There are similarities in economic and socio- cultural characteristics between residents in the two the types of districts. The residents living in poor economic condition, but under a very strong socio-capital and traditional beliefs; There can be seen several socio-cultural and particularly religious characteristics in people of historical residential districts that are similar with the spontaneous residential places, such as &amp;ldquo;strong relationship among families, friends&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hospitality&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;mutual relationship among family members&amp;rdquo;, strong religious beliefs and the needs for privacy and security. However, these communities are different in some principles such as quality of life and spatial and physical qualities especially in favorable and beautiful urban landscapes. So it can be extracted and adopted excellent principles from traditional and historical districts and adapt them to the inappropriate modern urban districts. With regard to the existence of these similarities, we explain applicable principles of the spatial characteristics and designing quality in the historical district of Yazd to apply in Baghshater District in Tehran as a spontaneous settlement. Findings show that we can use several solutions to reconstruct this zone included: 1) land readjustment as the suitable solution in Baghshater District with regard to the familial residential pattern in historical zone of Yazd such as Fahadan District. 2) Focusing on the traditional concept of mutual relationship in residential houses. 3) Emphasizing on the hierarchy of The entrances and exits of the residential units.

			<CONTENT>Study on international political economy of two countries, Sweden and Norway, in international interactions allows us to examine political economy of these two countries as the case study for further understanding of macro patterns of international political economy.&amp;nbsp; Thus, understanding the power of influence of international developments in two economic and political areas in internal relations of countries refers to one of the necessities in this research. The present research displays how a constant pattern such as the welfare state pattern can change under influence of global relations or loses its some principles, i.e. the vice versa of this rule is true. In other words, we face impact and effectiveness of the two sides of the exchange. Without doubt, movement toward pattern of welfare state generates behaviors, patterns and considerations at the area of foreign policy of Sweden and Norway, which we will examine them in this research.

			<CONTENT>Study on international political economy of two countries, Sweden and Norway, in international interactions allows us to examine political economy of these two countries as the case study for further understanding of macro patterns of international political economy.&amp;nbsp; Thus, understanding the power of influence of international developments in two economic and political areas in internal relations of countries refers to one of the necessities in this research. The present research displays how a constant pattern such as the welfare state pattern can change under influence of global relations or loses its some principles, i.e. the vice versa of this rule is true. In other words, we face impact and effectiveness of the two sides of the exchange. Without doubt, movement toward pattern of welfare state generates behaviors, patterns and considerations at the area of foreign policy of Sweden and Norway, which we will examine them in this research. However this multi-variable equation has not yet on the stage of final settlement and in some cases the relation between Norway and Sweden has not yet defined with the developments in the new world at the area of international political economy, definition for what going on is required to understand this complexity and the reason for creation of some ambiguities.

Ultimately, this research is the necessity for our country to use the interactive pattern existing in Scandinavian&amp;nbsp;countries at the area of international political economy. however, there are huge differences between our country and Scandinavian&amp;nbsp; countries in terms of geographical position, population size and financial facilities, it can use some of the patterns of welfare state in our country and some of the behavioral patterns of Norway and Sweden in international relations to progress the political and economic relations of our country in international system.

			<CONTENT>The electronic industry suffers a rapid changing and highly rival environment. Thus, firms have an essential need to strive for acquiring the competitive advantage. Strategy Organizational Agility (SOA) is a tool which enables to assist firms to attain the competitive advantage. Therefore, this study benchmarks the core competencies from a case study within the supply chain network and establishes a set of attributes for augmenting SOA. A novel multi-criteria decision-making structure is proposed to deal with the complex interrelationships among the aspects and attributes. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network can use linear learning algorithm to complete the work formerly handled by nonlinear learning algorithm, and maintain the high precision of the nonlinear algorithm. However, the results of RBF would be slightly unsatisfactory when dealing with small sample which has higher feature dimension and fewer numbers. Higher feature dimension will influence the design of neural network, and fewer numbers of samples will cause network training incomplete or over-fitted, both of which restrict the recognition precision of the neural network. The competence and accountability indicators can the continuously increasing level of agility to be effective. According to the analysis chart production and product design performance indicators alone cannot level a considerable amount of agility to change. But reducing the level of the index level of agility is reduced. Flexibility indices speed and agility level changes can also affect the organization. But with increased levels of these two indicators increased agility rate change indicators will be more flexibility. The results showed that customer knowledge management impact on organizational agility and organizational effectiveness and customer knowledge management through organizational agility has significant positive impact on organizational effectiveness. Finally, some practical suggestions, future research suggestions and research limitations are presented.

			<CONTENT>The Internet along with many advantages has some disadvantages, and the lack of a complete understanding of cyberspace can cause damage in terms of mate selection method. This article attempts to address some of the disadvantages and threats that virtual spaces create in mate selection method and tries to introduce some strategies to prevent and reduce these emerging injuries. This study was conducted using a questionnaire survey and the reference method. The population of this research is all youth between 20 to 34 years old who live in Jahrom in 1395. The sampling methods used here is the cluster sampling method. The sample size has been calculated by the Cochran formula, and 320 people were selected. The questionnaire was 0.77 alpha general questionnaire and statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software in the form of analyzing the correlation coefficient and regression.&amp;nbsp;In this research, after describing the stages of major indicators of family position as the most important unit of society, and after declaring the ideas about mate selection and cyberspace relationships, and mentioning them as opportunities and threats, emerging injuries following by cyberspace relationships and their influence on the mate selection methods are discussed.&amp;nbsp; In this study, family attachment, traditional values and the level of religiosity are effective in young people attitudes to cyberspace mate selection, as well as effective variables have an impact on mate selection method with a coefficient of 0.611% were able to predict changes. In other words, effective independent variables have been able to define 0.611% of changes in mate selection methods, and the rest of the effects are due to some variables that are not included in this study.

			<CONTENT>The main goal of this research is studying the causative &amp; effect of deficit budget, money offering and inflation rate in Iran during 1360-1390. The results in long time indicates that the bulk of money has had positive effect &amp; meaning on inflation rate during that time and alteration of budget deficit of the government has also positive effect on inflation but by meaningless impress, in other words this alteration has no independent impress from other alterations and specially form the bulk of money on inflation. Also on the basis of the results of Grenjer causative test, there is a direct relationship or indirect among all the alterations in the model. In regard with the results, money offering is one impressive alteration on inflation and continued increasing in offering the money leads to increasing of inflation. In other hand there is a causative relationship between budget deficit and inflation. Increasing the inflation causes increasing the expenditures and decreasing the revenues therefore by considering that high percentage of budget deficit in Iran to be supplied by central bank that has expansible effect on the total demand &amp; price levels. It is necessary that budget deficit to be supplied from other ways except receiving the loan from bank system such as getting loan from people and selling governmental valuable papers.

			<CONTENT>In last decades, the skillful planning of land resources has become a major issue for rural development. The development of cultivated areas becomes gradually impossible due to ever increasing population growth and urban development. Fuzzy logic is preferred to Boolean logic for land evaluation, because fuzzy techniques lead to estimate for land use suitability on a continuous scale and can therefore, be more informative than the Boolean technique. The objective of this study is to apply fuzzy set methodology in the context of a decision making process known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to land evaluation for irrigated wheat. The results revealed that the results obtained with fuzzy AHP method are in better agreement (R2=0.911) with the observed yield as compared to those obtained with parametric method (R2=0.804). Although, the fuzzy AHP provided more efficient and accurate results than parametric method, the choice of membership functions, width of the transition zones and weight values are determinant to achieve its realistic results in land suitability assessment.

			<CONTENT>One of the increasingly important organizational considerations involves occupational health and staff safety. Hence, it is crucial for the managers to identify the key organizational factors contributing to reduce work-related accidents. This study was conducted on 340 workers, employees, experts, supervisors, directors, and managers. The data evaluation involved a questionnaire while the analysis involved SPSS. Additionally, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis test were employed. With regard to the main criteria, the HR training procedure had the highest effect while the HR hiring procedure had the lowest effect on work-related accidents. Considering that HR training procedure has the greatest effect on reducing work-related accidents, it is critical to continuously optimize the training courses; There by to curb the major work-related accidents.

			<CONTENT>One of the significant dimensions of human&amp;rsquo;s social growth is his moral development. The human being not only is a rational and intellectual being, but also is a moral being. His morality has its origin in his sociability. The human being not only is self-centered and concerned about his own interests and well-being, but also is concerned about others&amp;rsquo; interests and their judgment of his actions and behavior. In addition, emotional perception of moral and ethics is also concerned about the importance of emotion in a moral approach; therefore, when we, as human beings, draw a line between emotion and intellect, and consider them as totally unrelated, we are actually heading in the wrong path. The results of this study revealed that the main categories of moral action consist of: knowledge management, decision making, individual&amp;rsquo;s will, coherency of moral perception. In addition, the main theme which was derived is culture. The culture theme was the most important theme derived from this study. This study tried to investigate Blasi&amp;rsquo;s moral action theory in the context of Iran.

			<CONTENT>Although liability under general tort and contract law principles is not limited to a certain amount, liability arising under a carriage contract is limited by the majority of international transport conventions and national legislatures and, there are certain reasons given to justify the &amp;ldquo;essential departure from the current rules of civil law&amp;rdquo; and it is common for the liability of the carrier to be limited under the international regimes regarding transportation. The limitation of liability, which is nowadays considered to be a basic right rather than a privilege, is not a matter of justice, but merely a matter of public policy. Naturally, under modern transport law regimes, willful misconduct is not the only situation whereby the carrier or ship-owner loses his right to limit. Conventions regarding means of transportation, particularly road carriage, also employ provisions for breaking the limits. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of willful misconduct and gross negligence of road carrier in CMR, CVR, and COTIF 1999 (CIM and CIV) conventions and for this purpose admitted solutions in said convention is discussed.

			<CONTENT>Salmas plain is located at the west of Uremia lake and at the 75 km of north of Uremia city. The main river of the plain, called Zulachai, is drained into Uremia Lake. Salmas aquifer is one of the coastal aquifers of Uremia Lake and has hydraulic connection with the lake. The recent draught occurrences and increased water consumption in agriculture and drinking sections water have not only caused regression of lake water, but also effected on coastal aquifer, such as Salmas plain aquifer. Over the long-term, average groundwater level in the Salmas aquifer has dropped sharply to 18/05 meters (averaging about 0/44 meters per year) and there has been 241 million cubic meters of reservoir capacity reduction. Salmas plain has two confined and unconfined Aquifers. Salmas annual depletion of groundwater resources in the study area during the water years of 2014-15 has been equal to 146 million cubic meters. The effects of land subsidence have been observed in some output areas (Kalshan and Qareh Qeshlaq areas).

			<CONTENT>Chivalry mores and etiquettes have never been limited to a specific time, place, or tradition, but the topic of discussion in this research holds some symbols of Chivalry mores in Iranian architecture in Islamic period. Chivalry principles, in Islamic period, are based on the pure nature of manliness and its origin and orientation goes back to Imams and prophets. By obeying and adherence to these principles, which have been called as Chivalry principles, people were categorized as the Chivalry. These mores have also been common in other countries such as Iraq, Anatoly, and todays&amp;rsquo; Syria. In early Islamic period, Chivalry mores was only peculiar to some specific people, but as the time passed guilds also founded some rules based on Chivalry, which must have been obeyed by volunteers willing to join that guild. The place and footprint of mores and etiquettes of chivalrous people in Islamic architecture works were studied in this research. To do this, Chivalry appearances in the architecture of Islamic period buildings investigated. Relying on the comparative and analytical reasoning between the moral principles of the Chivalry and the Islamic architectural works, some results were gained. Some of them are the existence of internal spaces, taken from the idea of confidentiality of the Chivalry and leaving the doors shorter in Islamic architecture of some structures like Zurkhaneh (gymnasium), to illustrate the humility and modesty while entering into such places.

			<CONTENT>Background and purpose: Managers&amp;rsquo; competencies leave a decisive effect on the mental health of staff. The present research intends to investigate the influence of emotional-social competencies on the mental health of the staff. Method: the current research is practical in its purpose and correlative regarding data gathering. The statistical community included all the staff of Pegah Company in District 3, which were 221 persons selected through simple random sampling. The assessment tools of this study were standard Boyatzis questionnaire for emotional-social competencies of managers from the staff&amp;rsquo;s point of view and Goldberg general health questionnaire for the mental health of the staff. The validity (content, convergent, divergent) and reliability (load factor, composite reliability, and Cronbach&amp;rsquo;s alpha coefficient) were employed which indicated that assessment tools have acceptable validity and reliability; and the gathered data were analyzed by SMART-PLS2 and descriptive statistics with SPSS21. Findings: the outcomes of this study indicate that t coefficient ranges between emotional-social competency, emotional competency and social competency with the mental health which were respectively 7.46, 5.21, and 10.46. Also, the values of R2 coefficient of determination were 0.71, 0.67, and 0.54 respectively which are desired results. It shows that emotional-social competency, emotional competency and social competency leave positive and significant impacts on mental health. Conclusion: the results of this study attests to the importance of managers&amp;rsquo; emotional-social competency for mental health of staff. Thus, the organizations should employ some strategies for the managers to acquire emotional-social competencies and accordingly improve mental health of staff and attain organizational goals.

			<CONTENT>The political and social system involved in the limbo between tradition and modernity of the Qajar Era caused widespread and quick developments in Iranian culture, art, and architecture as well as a challenge between tradition and modernity. Relatively numerous palaces built in this era were signs of greatness and distinction-seeking of the Qajar kings and aristocrats, who embraced all transformations of architecture in their era and played a significant role in changing Iranian architectural values. Therefore the purpose of the present study is to investigate developments in architecture of the Qajar Era and their effects on the evolution of palaces in this era. Using case studies methodology and referring to historical sources, contemporary studies on Qajar architecture and field studies conducted on outstanding palaces of this era, it can be concluded that the continuation of Safavid architecture early in this period, Qajar kings' tendency to Iranian ancient architecture, and the culmination of the architectural influence of the West in the Nasserid Era were the main factors effective on the formation of Qajar palaces. Moreover, the evolution of these buildings has occurred in three pre, early and late Nasserid Eras with various traditional, eclectic and European characteristics regarding the construction period and the effects of the above factors on the evolution of plans and circulation systems, facades and sections, materials, decorations, and architectural elements. In addition to shedding more light on common features of architecture and decoration of Qajar palaces, the study tried to determine their general and specific differences.
