So, the main questions in this study were: what is the similarity among the world popular models about instructional design and workplace learning models? What is the most adaptive model about training and workplace learning in petrochemical industry? Therefore, a qualitative meta-synthesis approach has been used to reply these questions. This process was conducted in two steps. Its first step was conducted by Sandelowski and Barroso method in 2007. The second step was conducted by analysis of documents, observation, and experts' views using Maxqda software. Finally, the related adaptive model to the characteristics of petrochemical industry was offered including five dimentions of: performance analysis, performance design, performance development, performance implementation, and performance monitoring which were adopted from 70:20:10, Mager and human performance technology models. Regarding the dominant systematic approach in instructional design and workplace learning model, and considering of performance conception in all designing processes, it seems that the present study,as the first study in this field, can have an effective role in organizational training&lt;span dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;br&gt;

						<description>&lt;span new=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 90%; font-family: &quot; times=&quot;&quot;&gt;Awareness of employees’ attitudes has always been used as one of the important management tools in organizations. Because, employees’ attitudes can affect their behavior in the workplace. Therefore, it's important to understand what factors can affect it. In this regard, due to the increasing level of employees' maturity in many organizations and becoming knowledge-based, two factors of organizational trust and psychological contracts in this research have been considered and their relationship with employees’ attitudes has been studied. In this process, by analyzing the theoretical foundations and the relationship between the factors and components constituting each of the variables studied, the conceptual model of the research has been extracted and tested in one of the companies of the National Iranian Oil Company. The research method used in this research has been descriptive correlational. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between the three variables of organizational trust, psychological contracts and occupational attitudes with each other. Also, the mediating role of psychological contract in the relationship between organizational trust and job attitudes was also confirmed&lt;/span&gt;</description>
