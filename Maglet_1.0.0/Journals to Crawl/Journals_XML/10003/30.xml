				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[There is the lack of sufficient attention to theoretical identification of real-life policy making strategies in Iran. The policy describes a strategy for coming prescriptions. One of the most controversial policies in our country is the self-sufficiency policy; a policy that has faced with different interpretations and preferences in each era and has led to several outcomes. There are several justifications for political differences in the policymaking literature (the researchers reviewed all the speeches, critiques and related contents regarding self-sufficiency policy consisting of 1398 documents to identify the origins of the policy making controversies) and in this paper by enumerating the most important items according to Rein and Schon’s theory, we will explain those items (scientific approach, competing interests among the parties and policy controversies as frame conflict) and we will measure their effectiveness in the study of research topic.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[Merger of state organizations is a kind of restructuring and an administrative reform strategy in Iran public sector which results in a new organization in the body of the government which has a great impact on organizational performances. The main concern of this research is the failure of merging of public sector organizations in Iran which requires its scientific review with managerial approach. This study aims at developing structural equation model for merger in Iranian public sector. In other words, in this study, we tried to identify factors affecting the successful merger of state organizations in Iran. Research methodology is applied in terms of purpose, and descriptive survey in terms of data collection. The statistical population of this study consists of 35 merger organizations in Iranian public sector. A sample size of 32 organizations were selected using Morgan table, and data associated with the variables of merger performance and factors influencing successful merging were gathered using a seven-point Likert scale survey questionnaire. The results of structural equation modeling using PLS method confirmed that the merging of state organizations in Iran has not been successful so far. In addition, there are some factors affecting successful merger of state organizations in Iran including “trust making and fairness”, “management of the differences”, “conflict and ambiguity”, and “knowledge management and integration”. The findings of this research can be implemented in policy making, and the proposed model is effective in promoting domestic knowledge in the field of merger.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The present study aims to rank the affective factors on the effective implementation of Public Policies and to design and propose an Effective Public Policy Implementation model based on the dimensions and parameters in the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration. This study is exploratory in nature and uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (mixed-method). Initially, qualitative and, more specifically, categorical (inductive) content analysis methods were utilized to collect data purposefully from the hard copy and electronic resources in the field of public policy implementation. Then, in the second phase, a researcher-made questionnaire was used to determine the dimensions, indices and parameters of public policy implementation using Delphi technique. Later on, the model was evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis. Data analysis was conducted within two descriptive levels using statistical indices of mean and standard deviation and one inferential level using LISREL and SPSS22 computer software. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were applied as well. The proposed model was confirmed and its absolute fit index was calculated to be 0.58. This value confirms that the fit index of the proposed model was approved. In conclusion, the present study introduces a new model for effective implementation of public policy in the Customs Administration of Islamic Republic of Iran.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[This research was conducted with the aim of presenting an agenda for the reformation of the policies of administrative system in Iran using data-based theory. 16 interviews were conducted with the experts in administrative system. The data were analyzed using selective, open coding step and then research themes were presented. The results showed that causal conditions affecting the agenda for the reformation of policies of administrative system include structural and organizational areas, productivity, human capital, management, laws and regulations, and international relations. Intervening factors include: social networks, think tanks, lack of optimal budget allocations, and lack of motivation and continuous commitment of the managers and agents, which will affect the agenda for the reformation of policies of administrative system according to background factors such as political, socio-cultural, economic-technological, international and organizational- administrative trends. Moreover, the proposed strategies namely adaptation of capabilities, capacities, and capabilities of the administrative system with the role and tasks of an ideal and desirable government, as well as developing culture for an evolution and reform in administrative system, can result in positive consequences to administrative system reforms.]]></dcterms:abstract>

The aim of the research is to explain the role of health tourism policies in the development of a resistance economy. For this purpose, a combination of qualitative methods of thematic analysis and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) has been used. The thematic analysis was conducted through coding of the interviews and other written documents resulted in the formation of 10 common themes (social justice, discourse, indigenous patterns, endogenous, macro policy, market share consolidation, entrepreneurship focus, knowledge-based, outsourcing, people-centered) Eventually, having undergone the stages in Interpretive Structural Modeling and the establishment of paired relationships, these themes were ranked in four levels from the most dependent and, at the same time, the most important themes to the most independent themes.]]></dcterms:abstract>

				<dcterms:abstract><![CDATA[The system of governance in multi-firm projects that requires implementing a variety of companies under the consortium agreement can affect the performance of the consortium. According to the literature review and the recognition of the research gap, the researchers found it necessary to identify the components and criteria of good governance in the context of mega multi-firm projects in a consortium. The purpose of this study is to grasp the deep-seated influence of governance on mega multi-firm projects in a consortium and an understanding of utility criteria. Using qualitative and exploratory research methods, six upstream consortium of South Pars Project were investigated. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data and find any probable relationships between them. In the first step, the components of the existing governance and its consequences were identified; then, by repeating the interviews with the research community, the components of the good governance consisting of the structure, process, and governance mechanism were introduced. Finally, an optimum governance model was proposed based on the criteria of good governance and observing the interests of all the stakeholders in the project.]]></dcterms:abstract>

This study investigates the effectiveness of diverse career path orientation on the recruitment capability of customs clearance officers in Shahid Rajaee port with an emphasis on the capital intermediary variable of the business path. The statistical population of this study consists of 250 managers of Shahid Rajaee customs clearance companies. Then, a sample size of 152 people were selected randomly according to Morgan's table. To measure the variables of the research, Briscoe et al. (2006)’ diverse career path questionnaire, Davos and Svens (2008)’s employability questionnaire and Abbey and Lutans's (2007) career path capital questionnaire have been used. The reliability of the questionnaires was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha index, and structural equation modeling and PLS software were used to analyze the data. The results of the study showed that the orientation of a diverse career path, both directly and through the intermediating variable of the capital investment pathway, can increase the employability of customs' clearance officers.]]></dcterms:abstract>
