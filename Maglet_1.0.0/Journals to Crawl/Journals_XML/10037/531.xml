abstract ={Distribution of static active earth pressure on an inclined retaining wall, with frictional or cohesive-frictional backfill, has been studied in the present research. Based on the limit equilibrium concept, and by implementing the horizontal slices method (HSM), two formulations have been proposed for determination of critical failure wedge. Results obtained from these formulas and results of the suggested equations by other researchers have been compared. Findings of current study show that horizontal slices method is capable of predicting the stress distribution and angle of failure wedge for inclined walls with high degree of accuracy. In addition, this method is applicable for various conditions of soil and wall and is able to consider the slope of backfill, friction between soil and wall, cohesion of soil and the effect of surcharge, simultaneously. Application of achieved formulation from horizontal slices method reveals that active earth pressure on inclined walls is nonlinear for both frictional and cohesive-frictional soils and the center of mass point of the resultant force would be located in an elevation less than one third of the height of wall.},

title = {Stability study of Gachsaran formation slopes in reservoir of Gotvand dam with effect of reservoir recharge and dissolution of salty materials}, 
abstract ={Gotvand dam reservoir with over 90 km length is surrounded by Gachsaran, Mishan, Aghajari and Bakhtiari formations. The noticeable point in the dam reservoir is the presence of Gachsaran Formation that is composed of considerable volume of salt located  4 km upstream of dam. Salinity of dam water due to dissolution of salt in reservoir water can cause serious environmental problems. In addition to direct dissolution of salt in contact with reservoir water, slope instability can also influence on this process. Probable sliding in salty layers of slopes will insert a significant volume of salt in contact with reservoir water in a short time. In order to study the land-sliding process in reservoir area and also analysis of the effect of dissolution of salty layers on sliding, characteristics of dominant material engineering of mass constituent were defined by rock mechanics experiments. Then the results of performed tests on rock samples and GSI method were used to estimate the engineering parameters of rock mass. To investigate the land-sliding process in reservoir area and also the effect of dissolution of salty layers on sliding, some salt samples were transferred to the laboratory. Using circulation method, solubility of those samples were examined in different conditions. The results were generalized to the reservoir condition. Eventually, slope stability were analyzed by modeling with SLIDE software, considering different levels of reservoir water, influence of dissolution of salty layers. The obtained results indicate that slidings in reservoir area are mostly shallow and are caused by dissolution of salty layer.},

abstract ={Saline soils are of challengeable soils that may cause many problems in civil engineering projects. In this study, volume change behaviour of saline soils and also the effect of improvement and reinforcement on them have been investigated using laboratory tests as well as consolidation test, swelling pressure test and free swelling test. The case study is Amirkabir Highway which connects the cities Qom and Kashan.  Fifty four kilometer of this highway was deformed like waves due to existence of saline soils. The laboratory investigations showed that the studied soil has a considerable swelling potential which appears to be the main cause of damage to the highway pavement, therefore it is decided on improving the subsoil condition. The research program comprises of studying volume change behavior of saline soil, stabilized with lime and epoxy – resin polymer and reinforced with polypropylene fiber. Afterwards, results for two cases of stabilized and non-stabilized samples have been compared. According to the results, the main cause of swelling is soil disturbance and structure destruction of initial soil composition. Considering all of test conditions, it is appeared that, although lime is a traditional stabilization material but is economic for the most geotechnical projects and usage of polymer is suggested only in special applications due to its rapid setting},

abstract ={The previous studies underteaken in the region indicate that the Ekhtiarabad and Chah-Darya sinkholes have occurred as a result of dissolution of underground gypsum rocks. Hence, they represent the likelyhood of hidden and threatening caves in the region. The presence of gypsiferous formations having surficial karstic features attest to this supposition. So, in order to determine the possible dissolving sites which may contain caves, the electrical conductivity and evaporite dissolution index maps of Kerman-Baghin aquifier were prepared and matched with groundwater recharge and mobility conditions. Accordingly, four suspected hidden- cave sites were recognized which include a large area around Ekhtiarabad village (as the most suspected site), one spot at the northwest of Baghin Plain and two other areas (south of Baghin and south and southwest or Kabutarkhan). Based on the utilized hydrogeochemical criteria, these last two areas may contain hidden caves, but, due to unsuitable hydrodynamic conditions, the possibility seems weak.},

The examinations show that there is no correlations between results of physical tests and chemical criterions. In present research after preparing the results of tests on 18 borrow pit sources of clay materials of earth dams, we investigate the Dr. Rahimi's criterion with results of Pinhole Test and then bases on pinhole test results, we suggested the modified criterion of Dr. Rahimi's proposed general criterion. The results of investigations on the range of laboratory data shows that the correlations of Dr. Rahimi's proposed criterion with pinhole test is 63%, while this rate is 74% for our suggested modified criterion. Also it should be considered that Dr. Rahimi's criterion compiled according the results of 24 laboratory samples while suggested criterion in present research compiled according the results of 234 laboratory samples.},

abstract ={A regular set of large scale direct shear tests were performed to study gravel particle effects on shear strength characteristics of sands. The tests were conducted using direct shear apparatus with 300 mm × 300 × 170 mm shear box. Uniform, fine sand was used as the base material and mixed with 20, 40 and 60 percent of angular and rounded gravel grains with maximum size of 12.5 and 25.4 mm as oversized particles. All tests were performed on dry samples in drained condition. Samples were prepared in a relative density of 60 percent and tested using three surcharge pressures of 150, 300 and 450 kPa. According to the results, mixtures with angular and larger gravel grains show more shear strength and dilation compared to the mixtures contain rounded and smaller oversized particles. Enhancement of gravel content increases the effects of oversized particle on shear behavior of mixture. In this regard, some correlations for estimation of mixture's friction angle and shear strength were suggested based on gravel type and gravel content.},

title = {The Evaluation Grout Curtain of Alborz Embankment Dam Using Coefficient of Permeability and Cement Take}, 
abstract ={The Alborz dam rock foundation is composed of marl and sandstone. With regard to the proposed plan for the grout curtain in marly rocks (relatively soft and plastic( which is significantly different from the hard and brittle rocks, the boreholes spacing (influence radius slurry), injection pressure (resistance rock), and even the composition and concentration of slurry are important. In the present paper, in order to evaluate the grout curtain of Alborz Dam, emphasis has been placed on two important parameters, namely, the coefficient of permeability and cement take. The results of cement take suggest that the distance between the primary boreholes is long and there is no proper connection between the primary and secondary boreholes. Moreover, grouting results of the fifth and sixth series of grout holes imply that the depth of some of the sixth series of grout holes has not been attained at the water tightening surface. A review of the rate of the cement take - time - pressure graphs and cement take - time graphs on the right abutment indicates that the injection pressure has not been applied in accordance to marly rocks leading to unfavorable phenomenon of opening and closing of joints (hydrojacking). Notably, the check holes results on the right abutment indicate that water tightening at this area has been provided a satisfactory and acceptable job.},

title = {Prediction of Compaction Efforts of Fine-Grained Soils of Sarabi Dam Using Atrificial Neural Networks}, 
abstract ={One of the most important issues in the Reverse Analysis is analyzing the density resulting from the compaction of in fine soils. The conventional methods in d etermination of soil density are: sand cone, rubber balloon and nuclear density gauge. Trained neural network, as a suitable alternative for conventional methods based on models analyzed by those methods, is not only as accurate but it is also easier to calculate and implement. In the present article, a model based on multilayer perceptron of neural network is presented for prediction of the behavior of fine soils density in Sarabi Dam. The paper presents the implementation process and density of the soil layers. The input variables include 4 geotechnics and 4 implementation parameters. The geotechnic parameters consist of: optimum moisture content, maximum specific gravity, liquid and plasticity limit implementation parameters consist of: the number of cross rollers, thickness of the layers and density and moisture of the soil obtained from the site. The model is based on multilayer neural network, using the error back propagation approach and it is capable of calculating the density. As a result, the maximum specific gravity laboratory, using the aforementioned geotechnic and implementa-tion parameters, is presented. The method compates the maximum specific gravity laboratory accurately at almost 100 percent.},

abstract ={Huge amount of scarp tires have made a big environmental problem that its reduction assessment is an important aim for researchers. Reusing of these materials in different branch of industrial is concentrated. Because of elastic behavior and absorbing the energy, waste tires are concerned as a famous damper. As a more effective manner to check the seismic forces is reducing the entered movements to the structure, it seems that using soil-scrap tire mixtures acts as seismic damper and these mixtures can reduce the earthquake forces acting to the structure. In this research this mixture is modeled as a damper under the foundation and the bed rock depth is analyzed in both time and frequency domains. Obtained results show that using soil-tire mixture reduces the resonance amplitude, energy and the acceleration reached to the ground surface. It should be mentioned that increasing the depth of the bed rock, the act of the mixture as a damper reduces. The results show that this mixture has a better operation in strong ground motions. Using these materials is cheaper compared with other base isolation systems, more available, not requiring high technology and also it reduces both earthquake forces and environmental problems.},

In this new classification system, four major characteristics of rock are selected for evaluating the rock sawability. In total, each rock takes a new score from 10 to 100 and classified into five classes: very poor, poor, fair, good and very good by new classification system. The new calculated rock sawability index (RSi) can be use as a useful index for evaluating the rock sawability. In the present paper, the relationship between ampere consumption, RSi and machine parameters are investigated by multiple regression. For this propose, 12 stones are tested by new sawing machine under different machining conditions (different depth of cut and feed rate). The results of this step are used as input data in SPSS software. Finally, two predicted models are presented with respect to machining parameters and RSi. These new models in stone factories can give a good viewpoint of energy consumption},
