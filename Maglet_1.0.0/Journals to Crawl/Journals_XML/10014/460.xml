			<abstract>
			Achieving competitive advantage and optimal performance by the companies and industries because of high rates of changes in the operational and structural environment and technologies is the most important challenge facing managers, therefore different theories and approaches has been proposed to overcome the problem. The theory of dynamic capabilities has been presented over the past two decades as a supplemental resource-based view to help us understand how to develop resources of an organization over the time and how to maintain a competitive advantage. In this article we have tried to present a conceptual model of&#160; the most impressive capabilities related to the resources re-configuration of dynamic capabilities that have significant impact on improving construction companies performance. Research models using data collected from 97 construction companies in the PLS software were analyzed. The results based on the structural equation modeling method reveals that learning capability as one dimension of internal resources re-configuration&#160; has the most&#160; impact on performance of construction companies.

			<abstract>
			In the current business environment, knowledge is a key capability to generate competitive advantage in organizations. However, effective knowledge-sharing among employees is affected by different factors and consequently could have various useful implications. Therefore, this paper intends to investigate the effect of personality traits on knowledge sharing and innovative work behavior as an integrative model in Research Institute of Petroleum Industry. A descriptive-survey and correlation methodology was conducted and a questionnaire developed for data gathering. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method also used to test research hypotheses. Result of analyzing 84 collected questionnaires from the organization indicated that personality traits of extroversion, agreeable, and openness have significant positive effect on knowledge sharing. It is also supported the significant positive effect of knowledge sharing on innovative work behavior. Finally, based on research findings, some practical implications for knowledge management practitioners to foster knowledge sharing and innovative work behavior suggested and research opportunities for future researchers to fill this research&#8217;s gaps proposed.

			<abstract>
			Human resource management is a collective act carried out by several players within project based organization. Typically in a project based organization, four players play the major role in management of human resources: project worker, line manager, project manager and HR specialists, which dysfunction in the HR organization can be explained by the weak interplay between two or more of these players. On the other hand, HRM practices have been changed based on projecetification and types of project- based work setting. Therefore, since the project- based organization is the main focus of this paper, firstly a clear definition of these kind of organizations is given. Then, the HR structure and organization in project-based organization and different types of project-based work setting explained. Later on, with discerning the HR structure and the role of all players in HR quadriad, and by means of objective data analysis related to limit and participation of RIPI project workers, the roles of HR players in RIPI determined and based on that, the structural model of HRM at RIPI designed for the first time in Iran. This paper also concludes some strategic guidelines and suggestions for the establishment of HRM in project based organizations in Iran.

The current research was conducted to present a model for training transfer in Tehran oil Refinery Company. Descriptive research method was adopted. Whole employees take apart with 360 people and the sample size by using the chart Kerejesy- Morgan included 186 members. In order to collect the data, Holton standard questionnaires (2000) as well as Salorenzo training transfer questionnaire (2004) were distributed among personnel's of operation unit by using simple random sampling technique. Descriptive and deductive statistical methods were applied for the analysis of the collected data using SPSS and lisrel. The results of the research demonstrated that the transfer of training has been favorable and in the medium level. There was a meaningful relationship among personal factors, educational factors and organizational factor with training transfer. In this research there was no meaningful relationship between self-efficacy, negative personal results, and supervisor's prevention with educational transfer. The most important effecting factors on training transfer were the educational factors with 0/69 path coefficient and then the organizational factors with 0/45 path coefficient and personal factors with 0/24 path coefficient, in order. Among educational factors, the most effective factor in educational courses has been the feedback. Also among organizational factors, the most important factor was the expectations from the functional results, and among personal factors; the most important variable was the capacity for the transfer. Finally the structural model of the effective factors on educational transfer was designed

			<abstract>
			The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of human resources empowerment components on the organizational commitment of the personnel of Iranian Gas Transmission Company using a descriptive and correlation method. The statistical population of the research has been the personnel of Iran Gas Transmission Company (Tehran Staff). In order to collect information, a questionnaire from Kuo &#38; et al. (2010) and in the 5-choice Likert scale has been used. Finally, 228 questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Applying SPSS software, the reliability of the questionnaire was estimated by Cronbach's alpha 0.919. This means that the questionnaire has a high reliability. The hypotheses of this study were tested using the structural equation model and using Lisrel software. The results of Laserl outputs show the positive and meaningful impact of human resources empowerment components (including sense of being competent, sense of being effectiveness, sense of trust, sense of independence, sense of being meaningful) on organizational commitment.

			<abstract>
			Competent project managers and competency-based training play a major role in project-based organizations and hence, ensure the success of projects. As oil projects are always subject to risks and hazards, developing human resources is an important function HR development programs must be based on real and immediate needs. This study aims at providing a model for developing staff in Iranian complex projects (case study of POGC). Hence, based on multi-methods approach, three strategies have been used to answer the research questions namely document analysis, Delphi technique, and benchmarking. To validate research findings, two techniques were used entitled member check and peer debriefing. Based on the findings, the overall HR development strategy at POGC owns a linear nature which comes in contrast with the company complex projects. Hence, the prescribed model is based on needs assessment from various perspectives (goal based and failure based), flexible and systematic instructional design, individual development plan, and goal based and performance based evaluation.

Furthermore, sharing knowledge plays an important role in organizational learning and creating an effective organization. Regarding the importance of the oil industry in Iran, the main and ultimate purpose of this research is to investigate the role and influence of knowledge sharing on organizational learning process concerning two mediator variables of the technology and social interaction in the oil Industry Pension Fund.

Data were collected by a questionnaire and then analyzed by the SPSS software. The results suggest that there is a significant relationship between knowledge sharing, and its dimensions, and organizational learning.
